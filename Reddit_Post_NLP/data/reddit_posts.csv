242,"A new Joker trailer dropped today, and it is marked as a ""Teaser"". But, dude, it's two and a half minutes long of footage from the film. That's a full on Trailer, there's nothing teasing about it. I feel like this is a growing occurrence these days, companies will drop like 3 minute videos, fully edited from many clips from the movie, paced like a traditional trailer, and then call it a teaser. Spider-Man: Far From Home and Shazam are recent examples I remember, but I'm sure there are more.

When did the meaning and purpose of a ""Teaser"" get lost? A teaser used to be like a 30 second spot, with at minimum a logo and maybe like some music or a sound clip. At best you get a shot of the main character or something, or even a short clip, but nothing like they are calling teasers these days.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just a nitpick, I guess, and ultimately it's not a big deal, I'm glad to have good trailers coming out. But it does bother me that what should be defined and understood terms are being misused. I'm just wondering is it some sort of marketing thing or did someone's understanding of what they were posting get mixed up.. Or has the distinction of what constitutes a Teaser changed? Like, if they only show footage from the first act, it can be a teaser?

&amp;#x200B;

I dunno, this is such a nonsense thing to get worked up about but it bothers me so much. Send help.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT - 

So u/TheHuntMan676 made a good analysis of the situation that I will copy/paste here:

&gt;Teaser - quick 30 seconds to 1 minute of footage (coming soon)  
&gt;  
&gt;Teaser Trailer - 1-2 minutes of footage with release date at end  
&gt;  
&gt;Official Trailer - 2-3 minutes of footage with some story and plot elements.

I was mentally separating the ""Teaser"" from the ""Trailer"", when I should rather view them as a whole ""Teaser Trailer"". Guess it makes more sense that way. Still think the naming is a little odd, just call it a trailer cause that's what it is, but now we are diving much deeper into a semantic argument and those never end well.

75,"With all the talk of the new Dune movie coming out I see a lot of people mentioning the canceled adaptation that almost happened in the 70s by film maker Alejandro Jodorowsky. It is considered by many to be the “greatest movie never made” and has become something of an urban legend in the industry. 

The thing is regardless of whether the film was a good *movie* it would have been a terrible Dune adaptation.

I see people talk about how good this movie would have been and how it would have been much better than the 1984 David Lynch movie (which is also notoriously unfaithful to the books) but I think those people must have seen that *Jodorowsky’s Dune* documentary but never actually read *Dune*, or they haven’t seen the documentary and have just heard the legends surrounding this movie. Or both. ...and they have definitely never seen a Jodorowsky film.

Let me clarify some things. First of all the documentary is good (watch it if you are a fan of Dune, Jodorowsky, H.R. Geiger or just film making in general) and Jodorowsky is a great film maker in his genre.

The large problem here is Dune is not Jodorowsky’s genre, like at all. Jodorowsky is considered a “filmmaker’s filmmaker” meaning he makes art pieces that are mostly only appreciated by people who work in filmmaking or film critique. His movies are experimental and not catered to mainstream audiences or even most smaller niche audiences.

Dune, as written, is a science fiction epic heavy with world building and political intrigue. While it also deals heavily with philosophical elements which would be more in Jodorowsky’s wheelhouse you cannot have one without the other and still call your movie Dune. In some regards Dune is Game of Thrones in space with its massive cast of intertwining plots that mostly revolve around different families and organizations plotting against each other for power or survival. Where Jordowsky was really interested in creating a bizarre visual masterpiece at the expense of the story to “simulate the experience of taking LSD” in a film as he puts it.

But furthermore the most glaring reason Jodorowsky was not a good fit for Dune was because, and this is by his own admission, *he never read it*. He didn’t even know the plot when he decided he wanted to make the movie, he had just heard that the book was good and kind of trippy. And throughout the documentary *Jodorowsky’s Dune* it was painfully clear he didn’t understand Dune at all. I could list dozens of ideas he mentions in the documentary that are completely *antithesis* to Frank Herbert’s novels but instead I will just share this quote from the documentary:

&gt;“It’s different. It was my Dune. When you make a picture, you must **not** respect the novel. It’s like you get married, no? You go with the wife, white, the woman is white. You take the woman, if you respect the woman, you will never have child. You need to open the costume and to… to rape the bride. And then you will have your picture. I was raping Frank Herbert, raping, like this! But with love, with love.”

...unfortunate metaphor aside I don’t know how much more clear he could make it that it he had *no intention* of making an accurate Dune movie, or even a movie that respected the spirit or philosophy of Dune.

Now am I saying the movie would have been *bad* \- not necessarily. I’m sure it would have been a great Jodorowsky movie, that is to say a good art house film, and with designs by Moebius and H.R. Geiger and an eclectic cast I’m sure the movie would have been visually interesting. But it wouldn’t have been Dune.

TL;DR - Jodorowsky’s Dune would have been a visually interesting movie but a terrible adaptation of Frank Herbert’s Dune.",movies,Lets talk about Jodorowsky’s Dune movie that never got made (and why it wouldn’t have been a good Dune movie).,Lets talk about Jodorowsky’s Dune movie that never got made (and why it wouldn’t have been a good Dune movie).

Its suspenseful, fun, interesting and bad ass all at once. At the same time it's not a heavy movie that I need to sit down and focus on by itself. If I want to work on something else while watching it I can, but if I do in fact decide to sit down and watch, it fills that role perfectly as well. Don't know if there's something wrong with me but I just literally can never get enough of it.

Are there really no statistics of lost Native Americans, although there are for any other ethnic group? And, why is that so?

&amp;#x200B;

I think that Sheridan did a wonderful job in telling his story, and I actually found Jeremy Renner as the lead to be incredibly powerful. It served as a relatable starting point to discover the relations and problems Native people have, even if I can understand the criticism of not casting a Native as the major lead.

It is a very sad movie with lots of gut punches, and a really solid script. I also like how it uses modern western conventions. It's action and shoot outs are never the purpose, they are pure consequence. The action is built up, but it's never long. That's something I also found in Sicario (2015) or Logan (2017).

&amp;#x200B;

*“Above all, I hate myself who have these thoughts. I chose to isolate myself. Maybe because I wanted to believe I wasn't isolated.”* 

I am not exactly a very mentally healthy person. I have had problems with anxiety and just have a general feeling of nothingness most of the time (Though, I haven’t been diagnosed so I won’t be saying that I have anxiety or depression yet). And there are very few mediums that have really touched with me in this aspect. The best example of it is probably Bojack Horseman. I have of course seen a lot of shows about mental health, but it’s only that one that has really stuck with me. Or that is until I saw *'A Silent Voice'*.

*'A Silent Voice'*, made by Kyoto animation and directed by Naoko Yamada (Mainly known for her work on K-on, Clannad and now this), follows Shouya Ishida who starts bullying a deaf girl in his class by the name of Shouko Nishimiya. It’s all fun and games for Shouya until teasing goes too far and the class starts to turn on Shouya. The story sees Shouya as an older student who has cut off society from himself, and developed a sort of anxiety.

But even though he doesn’t want to talk to anyone, he still feels the need to tell Shouko that he’s sorry for all that he has done. At least before he dies. 

And why I decided to focus on Shouya in this synopsis, was because that’s what the movie is to me. The story is about Shouya Ishida, and the effects of being outcasted from society. It has themes of depression and bullying, and Shouko is definitely a big part of the story. But to me, it was Shouya who was the best part of the movie. The portrayal of social anxiety is such a masterfully written part of the movie that it is hard to forget. And while I wouldn’t say the movie focuses on giving depth to this anxiety, it has so many small moments that explain so much about his characters. From giving voices of which he can’t hear of his own, or the crosses drawn over every face so that doesn’t forget that he isn’t allowed to look at them. And that’s what makes Shouya such an amazing character. So good that I would consider putting him on the list of best characters of all time. 

But while Shouya was a fantastic character, I felt that the characters in general were very inconsistent. While there were more characters than Shouya who were great., like Shouko herself and Nagatsuka, I feel the attention that the side-characters get is way too much. It is what fuels this inconsistency. 

I think the way they approached this movie was that they wanted every character to feel realistic. Or at least that’s how I felt that the comic was meant to be. But since a movies can’t be 5 hours long (unless you want to look “artistic”), many characters were left out on this depth obsession. While many character had a lot of depth, a few of them didn’t have any. An example of this is Ueno. She is a character who feels extremely one-sided and doesn’t really get any development, even though she deserves it. And this is probably the main thing about the movie that I disliked. If the characters were more balanced, I felt it could’ve been amazing. but since the movie feels very unfocused, it made me enjoy the movie less. I can endure characters that don’t have a lot of depth. Your Name, one of my favorite movies of all time, doesn’t have a lot of depth in it’s characters. But they were consistent, realistic, got development and were likable (I didn’t want to bring up Your Name, but it’s a good example of what I’m trying to say) And I can’t say that all the characters in *'A Silent Voice'* did that to me. 

But now it feels like I’m giving this movie a bad impression. Cause really, *'A Silent Voice'* is a great film. While it had inconsistent characters, the story was kind of amazing. Aside from some weird dialogue, it was very powerful. The scene where Shouko tries to kill herself, the last scene where Shouya kind of gets over his problems or even some of the tiny moments where Shouya shows his anxiety, it honestly made me cry cause I realized how much my life was fucked up. I saw myself, when I was really seeing a character. 

And one last thing. I am not a very big fan of most music in anime. Most of what I have heard feels very samey and bland. But every once in awhile, I hear something great. Something astonishing. A few examples of this would be ‘[*Terror in Resonance*](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4716160/?ref_=ur_urv)’ or ‘[*Your Name*](https://letterboxd.com/artistwithaname/film/your-name/2/)’. And I can honestly say that the music in this movie can be put in the same list. I had never heard *Kensuke Ushio*’s music before, so this was a first impression. And WOW, was this a good. While I like ‘*Your Name*’s and ‘*Terror in Resonance*’s music more, I find Kensuke’s music so fucking good. While it isn’t something you’ll have in your head all day (except for a few pieces), I don’t think a soundtrack is supposed to do that. It is supposed to immerse you into the world and tone of the movie (or show). And I think that’s why I love Kensuke’s music so much. Cause he’s perfect at conveying tone.

So that’s it. While I found some characters to be inconsistent, it was honestly a very enjoyable watch. A movie I’ll probably rewatch numerous times, and a movie I won’t be able to stop thinking about (Mainly because of Shouya). It isn’t my favorite movie of all time, but it deserves a place in their, somewhere. For now at least.",movies,Why I found 'A Silent Voice' to be so great,Why I found 'A Silent Voice' to be so great

7,"There are plenty of examples, but 2 from the 73rd academy awards in 2001 irk me in particular:

Russell Crowe did not deserve best actor for Gladiator. I love Gladiator, and he did a fine job as Maximus, but there were numerous other actors in the movie that outshone him: Joaquin Phoenix (who lost to Benicio Del Toro in Traffic), Connie Neilson, Richard Harris, and Oliver Reed (even though some of his scenes were posthumous CGI) to name a few. As for the lead actor competition, he won over Tom Hanks for Cast Away. Tom Hanks, who made me cry when he lost a ball. I cry every damn time I watch that scene. For someone who was nominated for best actor 3 years in a row, I think his acting ability is overrated. He’s done some fine work, and he’s been given loads of great roles, but when you see him work alongside superior actors, it becomes more evident that he is not that great. For example, Jennifer Connolly easily outshone him in A Beautiful Mind, and was rightly awarded best supporting Actress. I recently watched Boy Erased, and it was abundantly evident that Nicole Kidman, while at times also a little overrated herself, was on a whole different level to Russell. 

Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb in Requiem for a dream lost out to Julia Roberts for Erin Brockovich. Julia also did a fine job, but it didn’t even come close to Ellen Burstyn’s portrayal as a lonely aging woman descending into prescription drug induced psychosis.

In Brawl In Cell 99, the violence is brutal and I would argue rightfully so because of the environment and circumstances requiring it. In ""Dragged Across Concrete"" which is a crime thriller (don't worry no spoiler) someone is killed in one of the most insane grotesque needless scenes I've scene in a long time. There was ZERO reason to show the death. The only thing I can think of that is similar is in Inglorious Bastards with Hitler, and it's no surprise it's Taratino, but the difference I think is he always does it in comical and silly way in which you go, of course he has kool-aide like blood spurting out in water ballon popping fashion.

15,"If you don't know what flanderization means, it's basically when a movie sequel or tv show simplifies its characters to having one trait. It stems from, well, Ned Flanders, who started off as a more well rounded character and became a one dimensional christian joke over time.

Anyway what are some examples for you?

Both Dumb and Dumber sequels, both When Harry Met Lloyd and Dumb and Dumber To. In the original, Harry and Lloyd were obviously stupid, it's literally called Dumb and Dumber for a reason, but they were stupid to a point, as dumb as they were, there were definitely things even THEY would be too smart to do or there would be things even they noticed. For example, Harry noticed him and Lloyd were struggling to make ends meet and was trying to get Lloyd to be more safe with money. In the sequels, however, their stupidity is really, really exaggerated, if something is stupid, they'll do it no matter what it is.

Same thing kinda happened with Sid the Sloth in Ice Age 2, though in a different way. In the original, he was an idiot but he was still a mostly nice guy and never said anything really malicious or mean. In Ice Age 2, he is apparently so stupid he  keeps making fun of Manny the Mammoth's sadness about possibly being the last of his kind and he dances with a bunch of vultures when they sing about eating everybody. He's portrayed as so stupid he basically becomes an asshole but it's okay because he's too stupid to realize he's being an asshole.

Also Therman Merman in Bad Santa 2. In the original, Therman was naive and innocent but also shy, quiet, and reserved, only really being talkative when he was talking about Santa and Christmas with Willie but otherwise he kept to hismelf. In the sequel, they keep the naive and innocent part but make him less shy and make him a really giggly, happy manchild who always wants to make friends. In other words, they turned him into Buddy from Elf, except with a much deeper voice, which honestly made him really, really creepy.

Same thing happened with Marcus. He went from being the straight man to Willie who wanted him to get his shit together that was also horny and the butt of short jokes to a character whose sole purpose in the movie is to either be horny or be the butt of short jokes. There is a thing about there being tension between him and Willie considering he, y'know, tried to kill Willie last time but it's only mentioned a few times and it's a pretty damn underdeveloped plot point, mostly his role has been reduced to being made fun of for being short and getting horny.",movies,Sequels that flanderized characters,Sequels that flanderized characters

8,"**Intro stuff:**


If you’re looking for a raunchy, affectionate, well-written underdog romance, then look no further than Long Shot. From the crassly funny comedy, to the surprisingly well-balanced ethical themes, to the laden exploration of what it means to “present oneself”, and of course the romantic vibes themselves, this movie has a lot going for it. 


I’ve enjoyed my fair share of romantic comedies and straight up romances, but have seldom found myself cackling up a storm whilst awwwing across scenes. With a wit that reminds me of early Judd Apatow films, this film may have actually knocked out Knocked Up as my favorite naughty romcom slot.  


**Cuteness as a Cerebral Cornerstone**


I feel like the ideal romcom tries to tip-toe a very delicate balance between being heart-warmingly sappy, believable, and inspiring – without succumbing to the always unsavory criticism of being “too cheesy”. It’s tough, ya know? To make a romance seem approachable, make audiences feel like “that could happen to me”, and tug on the feel-good heart-strings. 


Several serious romances have impacted me wildly (like Call Me by Your Name, my fave film of last year), but I give extra props if a film can manage to be hilarious whilst managing sweetness. Long Shot’s light touch and tone maintain a solid momentum all the way through the film due to the charm and caliber of Theron and Rogen, but I never felt it veering into cheesiness (which I define as moments a movie breaks or oversteps its intended tone). 


At its core, it’s a film carried by these two leads and it cements Seth Rogen as a surprisingly charismatic atypical romantic partner. We see a fun juxtaposition of partners.  Rogen’s character is impassioned but considerate, laughable but adorable, and judgmental yet amenable. Theron’s character is powerful yet vulnerable, intimidating yet intimate, and motivated yet caring. The blossoming of affectionate between two unlikely lovers is, as the title suggests, a Long Shot, yet written with enough grace and performed with enough chemistry to make their pairing pretty believable. 


Like a boxing movie’s training montage, the romcom’s vehicle for quick progress is a “date montage”, and this film doesn’t quite have that luxury due to the constraints of the Secretary of State’s limited schedule. So instead of big powerful gestures, the movie is forced to explore subtle affection between the two. 

The exploration of non-public romance building appealed to me, and may certainly hit some notes for folks not Out, or folks keeping their love on the DL. 
This component of building a romance out of the public eye is a romantic setup that I don’t know I’ve seen before as its core theme. With the Secretary of State’s need to embrace the public eye, appeal to as many masses as possible, and be “presentable” at all times, the movie often weighs what it means to be “authentic” with what it means to be “consciously charming”. 

One of the early scenes with Theron’s character sitting in a meeting analyzing her most desirable public traits is a spring-board into various themes around self-awareness, personal integrity, ethical advocacy, and what it means to be a sweetheart. I might even go as far as saying this film tries to subvert various tropes such as the jealous lover, but then it explores oft-seen ones like “the nerdy guy gets the girl” in a naturalistic way. The relationship between attractiveness, charm, and authenticity is kind of up to the audience, but it worked better than I expected. Perhaps it’s the film’s self-awareness at the absurdity of this trope that makes it land so well. 


With a strong core relationship, the rest of the film nails various parts to also create a surprisingly well-rounded comedy. 


**Raunch-City Raunch-Sauce:**


So, I don’t know if I was just in a jovial mood but my goodness this movie caught me off-guard with its humor. Offensive and raunchy and packed full of sexual humor, I found myself giggling like a goof pretty much throughout the movie. It’s got its fair share of physical comedy, topical humor (thank goodness *someone* is addressing the stepmother’s plight on Pornhub these days), and obviously political humor. 


Both of our leads are well supported by a hilarious best friend, the Secretary’s closest council, and a well-cast ensemble of various senators and presidents. Comedy often feels more subjective than other aspects of film, so your mileage may vary, but if you liked flicks like Game Night, Blockers, and Knocked Up, you may find yourself diggin’ the humor in this. 


**Filmmaking and Message:**


The movie itself is well-crafted, slickly edited, and well-paced. It never left me bored and moved from exposition to relationship building quickly, then marinated more on its own themes before sticking the romantic landing. 
In a movie that’s more about the performance and story, this movie had a phenomenal soundtrack and was surprisingly layered on the messages. This is likely due to the inherent nature of a political film, but environmentalism, the bi-partisanship of the US, a reduction of judgmentalness, and what it means to be homies that got each other’s backs are all themes that are touched upon. AND, it manages to touch on those themes without feeling ham-fisted and while maintaining a solid pulse on the laughter. That makes every single theme much easier to swallow, and it’s always mostly focused on the connection between the Secretary of State and her speech-writer.

 
Alongside the critique of the corruption of politics, there’s also an advocacy that suggests what the general public searches for in a partner is shallow and may need revision. There’s a lot of ways to explore this content, and it seems deeper for a romcom than I’m used to. But while I’m digging deeper than most in analyzing these scenes and the film’s advocacies, I can definitely also recommend this movie even if watching it just for the heart or just the laughs. 


**TL;DR:**


Long Shot is crazy sweet, hilarious, well-acted romantic comedy that uses its political vehicle to touch on various themes that explore the complexities of dealing with political opinion and what it means to present oneself. It’s endearing in its romantic depictions while coaxing guffaws out of most of the audience. 


**RECOMMENDATIONS**


**Recommended for fans of this genre?** 


Duh. If you like more comedy-focused romcoms and can handle a bit of raunchiness, then you should enjoy this flick quick a bit. It’s funny and sweet and has a defendable message. It’s in my top 3 romcoms at this point. What’s not to like? 


**Recommended for non-fans of this genre?** 


Yes. If this is your first romcom, I can say that it’s probably a great one for many demographics. It’s got solid representation of comedy, love, various gender consideration, political vibes, and its well-paced enough to hold your attention.

4,"So yeah I had never heard of this movie before so I borrowed it at my local library. Good on me cause it's great but man what a brutal twist there is around the last third. Spoiler of course:&gt;!Mary Bee Cuddy commits suicide after losing her virginity with Briggs!&lt;. This messed with me, much more than I would like to admit.

This being said, a movie is not only about a good sequence. This one is very coherent, riveting and has this ""realistic"" feel. The cast is very good, and even if I knew she was a good actress, Swank managed to add that little extra something.


I'm more and more admirative of Tommy Lee Jones, and can now definitely add his directing ability as a reason. *No country for Old Men* and *In the electric mist* were some of his relatively recent acting performances (among many others I certainly missed) that reminded me he was not only a long-faced Marshall or any other part fitting his looks but he also took part in movies that are special. I mean he's got a very personal vision and it's obvious. The dude knows exactly what he wants and does it good with the help of what looks like a fair number of people who know their cinema.

I like the way he talks about the great American plains of Nebraska (though it appears New Mexico was where it was shot) as an important part of the movie, creating emotion and reflecting the actual harshness of the west. The sequence where Mary Bee Cuddy takes a moment to stare at the flat scenery outside, right after deciding she would take the three women herself, talks a lot in this respect.

I'm fine with fashion movies (e.g movies that have fashion as their main premise, movies that are about fashion shows, movies that feature a fashionista as the protagonist, etc) but I would prefer it if the movie you recommend has nothing to do with the world of fashion and the reason why all these actors are wearing such amazingly stylish and breath taking dresses and clothing in so many mundane situations is simply a stylistic choice on the director's part. 

Also, I'm talking about movies that have **several** lovely outfits, like around 20 or more, not just 2-4 clothes.

My wife and I have been discussing who can talk to whom in the Pixar universe. 

All the pixar movies take place in a shared universe but not everyone can understand each other. 

Animals can all understand each other as seen in finding nemo and bugs life but humans can't understand animals as the dentist doesn't understand the fish or the pelican in finding nemo (except for certain magical examples like the crow in brave).

Toys can understand people and people can understand toys as seen in toy story.

Toys can't understand animals as they don't understand the puppy in toy story 2. 

It's unknown if animals can talk directly to toys. Nemo and marlin encounter a toy fish in finding dory that doesn't talk, but that might have been because there were people around. The puppy in toy story does listen to woody the same way it would listen to a human.

Monsters can't quite understand people as sully and mike don't understand mary/boo even though she is old enough to be verbal and can write her own name. It seems like the same is true the other way around as sully has to mime things for her to catch on.

Advanced technology can understand people and vise versa as seen in wall-e. If cars etc is set far into the future and are sentient machines they would have been able to understand people too. 

Its unknown if machines can communicate with toys, animals, or monsters?

It's unknown if toys and monsters can understand each other, or if animals and monsters can?

Its possible certain supers could be able to understand animals but no evidence has been seen.

31,"*A Nightmare on Elm Street* (1984) was my introduction to horror at the age of 5. It will forever be a movie I hold deeply in my heart as *one of the greats*. With that being said, I feel that the quality of the films took a substantial dive with the subsequent release of the following films, and not just from a storytelling perspective

One of the main problems with the *Elm Street* franchise is world building and adhering to the rules within the world that is being built. As an example, established rules are that what happens to a character in their dreams happens to them in reality (see Tina's bloody departure). Compare that with, say, Kincaid's bloodless death despite being completely gutted or Mark's bloody arm flopping onto his comic after being literally torn to shreds. The inconsistencies introduced with each new writer and director pulled me out of the movie and the established universal laws of its predecessors

Another problem that seems prevalent is the shoehorning of social agendas on hot topic issues as overarching storylines; *The Dream Child* (anti-abortion); *Freddy's Dead* (war on drugs); and so forth

The recasting of Kristen Parker and her mother was especially jarring when watching the films back-to-back, as was the transformation of Alice's alcoholic abusive father to caring father of the year (although we could probably thank her brother's untimely death to his sobering up)

Timelines are also an issue, as are the release of the kids from the institution with absolutely no mention of why. In fact, upon revisiting the institution from the previous film, the place looks like it had been condemned for decades, despite having been open and active order within the last few years as established by the previous films

The end to the franchise (until *New Nightmare*) was so incredibly goofy that it seemed like the script and the world in which it was built were created by two entirely different people. There was a chance for it to be a truly dark and horrific experience (at this point in the story, Freddy had killed basically *all* of the kids in town and driven the adults to psychosis) and there were points in the film that were genuinely unsettling (like the child statue with the engraving *The Children Will Endure*) but it was undermined by the product placement (Nintendo) and cartoonish modes of death (See Spencer's death (*SUPER SPENCE! groan*) and John Doe's death (*Freddy coming out of right field with the bed of spikes like a Roadrunner cartoon*)

The *meta as fuck* *New Nightmare* and great *Freddy vs Jason* surely reinvigorated the franchise with fresh concepts and callbacks, and, really, you could watch the first film and the last 3 and not miss much in-between, save for maybe a few world-building nods like the introduction of Hypnocil in *Dream Warriors* or the dream abilities from the same movie (which, I suppose you could argue that *Dream Warriors,* at least, should be included in the viewing experience), but the rest of the movies really took away from the Krueger mythos without adding much to it (like how they added the dream snakes to tell you how he got his powers over the dream world. Did we really need that?)

While the last two movies (*New Nightmare/Freddy vs Jason*) were a return to form and quality set by the original movie, the others felt like filler that only existed because people kept losing bets and owing someone a favor to make movies that just happened to carry the *Elm Street* brand and *Freddy* character forward for monetary purposes and not necessarily to make a movie that was good or worth seeing

I will argue that they (2, 4, 5, 6) are worth watching for the sheer terrible quality of the films, and maybe if you're feeling nostalgic, but there are certainly far better horror movies available from the same era that are far more worthy of your time

**POINT BLANK**

I almost didn't write about this one.  Among hardcore cineastes, Point Blank is very, very highly regarded.  It certainly can qualify as a cult film.  But I got to thinking about a general audience, and I wondered how many may have heard of this film.  Maybe not many.

Lee Marvin plays Walker, a career criminal who is double-crossed by his partner after a heist.  His partner, a man named Reese, shoots Walker and leaves him for dead.  Walker survives; he vows to find Reese and get back $93,000 - his half of the job.  But Reese doesn't have the money.  Those who do are about to learn just what lengths Walker will go to to get what is his.

If this all sounds familiar, it's because Point Blank was the inspiration behind the Mel Gibson vehicle Payback.  But where Payback was turgid and crap, Point Blank is vibrant, employing a jumping timeline, uncommon camera angles, quick edits followed by long, single-shot passages, and a very unique use of color.  Marvin liked John Boorman; though the star had approval power over the script, cast, and editing, he was so enamored with the young director that he allowed Boorman to have final cut.  

For those who are used to thrillers that only hit basic rhythms and have little in the way of imagination, Point Blank may be disconcerting.  It's far from typical.  But that is what makes it so worthwhile; its relentless creativity reveals new things with each rewatch.  For me, it's a familiar film.  But it has never been boring.",movies,"Real hidden gems, #5: Point Blank (1967, John Boorman)","Real hidden gems, #5: Point Blank (1967, John Boorman)"

Around the 20th of April last year, I watched ‘Your Name’. It was a movie I had heard all about. One of the critics I followed loved it (Chris Stuckmann) and it was talked about all around the community. I knew I had to watch it. But since it wasn’t in cinemas when I wanted to watch it, I had to buy a DVD (I didn’t have and still don’t have a blu-ray. Plan on buying a blu-ray player and ‘Your Name’ again). There was a lot of build up to watching this movie, since it took a little while for the movie to actually get to my house. But then on that day, on the 20th of April, I finally watched it.

I don’t think I can explain my experience through words. There was something about this movie that just clicked with me. Whether it was the characters or the story, something about it just… did something to me…

‘Your Name’ follows Taki and Mitsuha, two high school students who live on two very different parts of Japan, one being in the middle of Tokyo and one being in the country. One day, the two strangers switch bodies with each other. With Taki in Mitsuha’s body, and Mitsuha in Taki’s. We get to see how Taki and Mitsuha have to change their lives for each other. We see them grow and change through this body switch.

I am a person who likes to have everything in a movie to be as great as possible. I want the characters to be good, I want the story to be good, I want the visuals to be good. I want everything in a movie or show to be good. Now, this has lead to me thinking more about movies with my head rather than the heart. It has lead to me rating a movie/show lower cause I realized that the characters weren’t that memorable. It has led to me not feeling anything, cause I was just thinking.

If I look back at this film, it never feels as good as it does when you watch it. I look at the characters, and the story, and the music separately which leads me to slowly dislike the film. It’s not that I realize things about the aspects that make it worse, but just some weird feeling that it isn’t as good as I thought.

But when I watch this film, there is just something that happens. I’m completely engrossed by its story and characters, that it is hard to see some of the mistakes. Cause there are mistakes and flaws in this film for sure.

The characters could’ve had a little more depth, the story had some holes and the third act felt a little slower than the rest.

But whenever I actually watch the film, all of those flaws disappear in my head. The characters feel real and I’m invested in the story. I don’t think I can explain through text how much I love this movie. But I’ll try.

My favorite part of ‘Your name’ is how its story and characters have a connection. It doesn’t feel as if they wrote a story, and then wrote characters. They never felt separated but were completely connected. That the characters develop through this body change that occurs multiple times under the film. That Mitsuha and Taki learn about their desired lifestyle. How Mitsuha learns how stressful the life in the city is or how Taki learns about culture and connection in the country (it is never stated that Taki dislikes his life in the city, but it was something I wanted to add since Mitsuha shows the stress that is in the city). That Taki doesn’t do anything with his life until Mitsuha changes that, and how he repays her by saving her life.

Or how the story has themes of what the Japanese society is becoming. That they are drifting away from culture (religion) and into modernization and politics. About wanting to keep a balance between culture and modernization. A whether you should uphold tradition, or be yourself.

And how all of that being connected with the dreams that the main cast experience, of how they get to see how their wished lives would’ve been. They get to see whether or not it is their culture or their dreams they want to take force in their future. Whether they want to continue to live the life they have lived all of their lives, or if they want to make a risk and maybe feel a little uncomfortable but in the end live a better life.

In the end, I think the characters and story both embody the constant struggle between the two sides.

But then there’s also the constant feeling of looking for something that might fulfill themselves that is referenced. Whether it is a person, a place, or even just a job.

There are a lot of movies and shows that have a character or a plot element that I find relatable. But this the first time I felt the same about a feeling expressed in a medium. Maybe I explained it badly. The feeling of trying to find something that might fulfill yourself is something I think everyone has felt. Or maybe not even fulfill, but just trying to find something, cause you have the constant feeling that you need to find it.

I can’t believe I have gone through this review this long without mentioning the art.

There are a lot of shows and movies I would consider visual masterpieces. Like ‘Spiderman into the spiderverse’, ‘A Silent Voice’ or Ridley Scott’s ‘Alien’. And while I would still consider them a few of the most visually appealing movies of all time, there is something about ‘Your name\* that makes it so beautiful. Whether it is the incredibly detailed backgrounds that fit so incredibly well with the fantastic, or if it’s the coloring that brings the emotion so well together with its shading. It is a mystery I have yet to solve, but want to keep a secret. To have something to have unexplained.

And I can’t not bring up the music. Wow, what an amazing score. The work by ‘Radwimps’ is honestly something I admire completely. It is one of the few soundtracks that I almost remember completely. It is what makes many of the scenes into what they really are. It’s what makes so many of the scenes bone-chilling. It’s what makes so many of the scenes so marveling.

At the end of the day, I absolutely love ‘Your Name’. It is a movie that I think I will have in my mind for all of my life. A movie whose score will be stuck in my head for eternity. A movie who’s visuals will be ingrained in my brain. And a story of which will be cemented into my soul.

I have seen movies that I think are as good as Your name. 2001 a space odyssey, a clockwork orange are both two movies I think are about as good as this film. But in those two, it is more the thought-provoking and complicated story that they have. They aren’t necessarily movies that are made for the heart, but are still amazing for it. But when I watch ‘Your Name’, something about it just grabs me. I don’t know what it is, but the first time I watched it, I loved it completely. But I don’t know how to describe it. It isn’t a sad film, not necessarily a realistic one nor a romantic one. You could probably describe in many ways. but for me - it is the unnamable. Nothing more, nothing less, than a beautiful film

Edit: I’m honestly so glad I made this (these) posts. Whether it is negative or positive, I’m just glad that people are talking about Your Name again. I never really wanted to do a review of it, but I’m glad I did!

Edit 2: And last thing. I can go on and on about why I love this film. I can analyze every aspect of it. But the fact of the matter is that there is just one thing that makes me love it so much. Cause it makes me happy. I haven’t really felt that good for the past years. I’m not sad, not happy, I just feel an emptiness where my feeling should be. But whenever I watch this film or listen to it’s score, I’m happy. Or at least I think I am. I can feel a warmth inside of myself when I watch it, and I think that’s it. It has problems, but it makes me happy every time I watch it. And therefore, it is one of the best movies I have seen",movies,The masterpiece that was 'Your Name',The masterpiece that was 'Your Name'

2,"Never saw the movie, just the trailer. I think it accompanied a dvd re-release, maybe of Shawdow of the Vampire or The Lives of Others or Dogtooth...but you get the idea of the type of art house film.

It is shot in black and white. The entire trailer first part of the trailer is a single tracking shot of an apartment filled with girls/young women just lounging. It's almost a tableau, but with motion, the camera turns around the room, I think some are smoking cigarettes or reading magazines, while one of them plays the piano and sings in what sounds like an eastern European language. One of them notices that their mother is returning home and the girls rush around to clean as to not get caught. It feels like in could have been set anywhere from the 60s to the 80s.

45,"As the title suggests, I want your opinion. I am slowly introducing my girlfriend to sci-fi films and the wonderful world of *decent* cinematography, and she needs to watch Star Wars. But which trilogy first?

I have a feeling this might be a generational split with Star Wars fans, but I am curious if you think I should start her with the the Skywalker Saga, or begin with the prequels.

I am excluding the sequels as well as stand-alones or animated films. You might argue against that, but I've had no interest in Star Wars since it was sold to Disney.

Which series better represents the true intent of the films? I'm leaning towards the original, because I feel that someone who may be new to the genre would better appreciate how groundbreaking they truly were to cinema at the time. But how important is sequence to you?

Actually, I'm willing to bet most of you haven't revisited the prequels since you originally watched them. But maybe that's just the vanilla SW fan speaking in me.

5,"Checked this out on the weekend.

I know there are some people who don't like films with subtitles, but this is one that will really capture the attention regardless as it's kinda like Locke, in that it all happens in a small set, mostly over the phone. You certainly don't miss anything visual as you're reading the titles, so it's great if you're munching tacos.

It's about a Danish cop who's been suspended from active duty and is working in emergency calls and dispatch.

It's a little more formulaic than Locke, but it builds up a better intensity due to the genre, so it's really on the edge of your feet stuff. While I think Locke is a better piece of cinema, The Guilty is a better piece of entertainment, if only because it's more accessible and the subject matter allows for a more thrilling story.

Don't want to go into much more detail, because I think the less told is better, but I highly recommend it. ",movies,"The Guilty - (Danish, 2018)","The Guilty - (Danish, 2018)"

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **PROGRAMMING NOTE -** Just a quick note I want to address [the recent news](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/b83pau/a_welcome_note_to_our_new_friends_the_walt_disney/) of the purchase of /r/movies by Disney Co. While I am excited to now be paid to make these write-ups I understand the concern that a major producer of theatrical films is in charge. I want to make it very clear I negotiated complete control over my content with Disney and in no way will feature bias for their films. I will continue giving you my own personal opinions despite who's writing my checks. Okay let's do it
* **Dumbo (2019) -** In a shocking display, Dumbo opened to an incredible #1 with $45M. This broke records becoming the 5th highest debut for a March Disney live-action release, the 25th best debut for a film with a CGI lead (almost beating Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel), and destroying as the biggest debut ever for a movie about a smart elephant (I think, there's not a box office mojo chart about that). In comparison with other major programmers with hearty and audience beloved debuts like Nutcracker and the Four Realms ($20.3M) and Wrinkle in Time ($33.1M). Now this may sound like a major downgrade from the $116M that the last Burton directed Disney live-action remake, 2010's Alice in Wonderland, made but let's also note that both got an A- on Cinemascore and the joy of an audience is what really counts. It's also worth noting the original Dumbo is 10 years older than the original Alice in Wonderland so inflation really evens it out.
* **Us -** I guess it's worth mentioning that the $20M horror film had another whatever weekend where it made $33.6M, crossing over $125M domestic. Sure that all sounds impressive but let's see Universal try to sell Tethered Lupita action figures and novelty scissors at Target. Yeah, good luck.
* **Unplanned** \- I have a statement I need to read: *We at the Disney Corp do not engage in serious political and moral debates such as presented in the film Unplanned. We believe in everyone's right to express themselves and we invite you all to remember that Galaxy's Edge, the exciting new Star Wars land in Disney World and Disney Land where no one ever talks about abortion.*

The theatrical cut is meh but the director’s cut takes an ok film and turns it into a very good film. 

It’s a lot closer to Dave Benioff’s great script and it fleshed out a lot of the characters. It’s been re-scored and color timed better too that gives the emotional beats more impact. 

It’s also a lot bloodier, much akin to Homer’s Iliad, which gives the movie a lot more depth and themes. 

It also showcases Wolfgang Petersen’s skills as a director. He’s really clever with how he moves the camera.

21,"I’m going to try and not spoil the movies I’m discussing. Recently I have seen his movies Last Airbender, Split, and Glass. All three have his signature Shyamalan twist, of which all are absolute trash. The Last Airbender was white washed, badly acted, badly written, and was inaccurate to its source material in order to insert a twist that didn’t even pay off. Thank the film gods someone is making a new live action version. Split should have been a good movie, but took the concept way too far and involved it in a series it didn’t belong in. Some could also say it contributes to vilifying people with mental illness and calling victims of assault “broken.” As I said, the twist was unnecessary and only negatively impacted the movie. Even with its issues, I’d consider it the best of the three I’ve seen. Glass was an absolute train wreck (pun intended). Took an A plus cast and ruined them. Lines were cliche. The comic book metaphor was derivative. He gave himself a cameo just to give himself an Easter egg from his cameo in Unbreakable. There were so many subplots that there was never enough time to dive into anything enough to make a point. Honestly could go on, but my views are best described by a podcaster who makes a show called Mostly Nitpicking. Has an episode on Glass that really tears it apart. As for the twist, there was ABSOLUTELY no reason for it to be there. It opens up too many plot holes if you were to rewatch the movie. All it does is add 20 minutes to the movie that don’t need to be there.

Sorry if this was a lot, but from what I’ve seen Shyamalan’s use of his signature twist only makes his movies worse. I‘ve heard Sixth Sense is a good movie, but if anyone can suggest movies he’s made that aren’t absolute trash it would be appreciated.

EDIT: not trying to say Split is an inherently bad movie. It’s a good movie on its own, but due to its addition into the Unbreakable series puts a sour taste to it.",movies,M. Night Shyamalan needs to stop (opinion),M. Night Shyamalan needs to stop (opinion)

Then I remembered just how shoddy the story telling in the Star Wars prequels was and I'm glad they never made movies of all of this.

For anyone who wants to know, my problem with Star Wars is the cop out ""leaving Anakin for dead"" crap at the end of Revenge. If ObiWan really loved him, he'd have force pushed him into the lava to kill him quickly rather than letting him suffer there in pain taking hours or days to potentially die. But if he did that obviously there'd be no Darth Vader.

You might think this is the obvious answer, until you see films like Drums Along the Mohawk and No Country for Old Men, which not only are  both set outside of the 19th century (1776 and 1980 specifically), but are also considered Westerns, and do not include any of the elements that make up the traditional Western (no gunslingers, small towns, no hookers-with-hearts-of-gold, no Forty Niners, etc.)

So the question remains: what makes a Western a Western? It's certainly not the presence of Cowboys (since movies like Drums Along the Mohawk lack them), and it's certainly not the time they're set in, so what makes it what it is?",movies,What IS a Western?,What IS a Western?

Many of you remember [***Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween***](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/deep-blue-sea-celebration/)as the film that ended the run of the *Halloween* franchise. In 1996, the series was reeling after the poor performance of [***Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers***](https://youtu.be/-v8l6cCrf0w)*,* and it was given one last shot to stay relevant in the evolving horror market. Knowing that the series needed a change, the producers and executives at Dimension Films decided to send Michael Myers to Louisiana to hunt the brother he never knew he had. In a major casting coup, Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast as Police Detective Chance Strode, the long-lost older brother of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). JCVD’s career had hit a rough patch after *Street Fighter, Sudden Death,* [***Drop the Beat***](https://youtu.be/q6ObhNBURyY) and [***Spin-Kick City*** ](https://youtu.be/i31XFSORRfc)failed to hit at the box office, so, desperate for a minor rebrand, he signed on to play the role for a lesser-fee with money promised on the back end.

&amp;#x200B;

The producers at Dimension couldn’t afford to pay an established director, so they brought in stuntman legend and first-time director Steve Balsawood (stunts for *Lawrence of Arabia, Ghost*, [***Fire 2: Too Hot To Handle***](https://youtu.be/rvqm61CcOLo), and [***Backslap: The Movie***](https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw)*)* to direct a script written by a young writer named Chuck Finley, who had written the well-received and commercially successful 1995 horror film [***Don’t Throw That Knife At Me!***](https://youtu.be/HsRwyJw5o7k). If there was one concern, it was that the movie had to go from script-to-screen in a mere six months, which meant the filming would commence without a finished script and locations that were not fully scouted or vetted.

&amp;#x200B;

[Some concept art from the movie](https://i.redd.it/ivsbttm6xnp21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Desperate to bring in additional funding to beef up the $4 million budget.  The folks at Dimension signed a partnership with Yamaha to feature their X45 jet skis for a sizable amount that would help pay for the 23-day shoot. All was good until JCVD told the producers that he wouldn’t partake in any night shoots, which forced Finley and director Balsawood to revamp the script to make it a “day-time horror picture.” After several sleepless nights, and many unforgivable insults flung at each other, the two nailed down a script that played like a *Halloween* movie met *Nowhere to Run* and *Hard Target,* then completely forgot the *Halloween* angle\*.\* The highlight of the script was a jet ski chase that featured JCVD chasing down Michael Myers to make sure he can’t obtain the Spear of Destiny, which would make him even more immortal.

&amp;#x200B;

[I never thought I'd see Michael Myers wear a suit while riding a jet ski.](https://i.redd.it/ia6y4rmgxnp21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Shooting began soon thereafter and everything quickly became a nightmare due to unreliable jet ski prototypes, infighting, terrible weather, rewrites, adultery, rampant drug use, scurvy, bad shellfish, impromptu crying sessions and budget cuts which you can read about in Balsawood’s book [***I Hated Directing That Movie***](https://youtu.be/m2aC-nkV1Zg)*.* The rest is history, but one scene has always stuck with me and I finally decided to tackle it in hopes of making sense of it.

&amp;#x200B;

[JCVD and a friend ride around for seven minutes talking about how great the jet skis are. ](https://i.redd.it/fwcr41rcxnp21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

The following breaks down the incredibly random jet ski chase during the climax of the movie. I read in Balsawood’s book that they only had one day to shoot the scene and no locations to film the actual chase. So, the director, JCVD and a masked stuntman went out to a tiny island on the last day of principal photography and shot several hours of footage near the island. During their shooting, JCVD and the stuntman were only able to drive around the island 12 times due to the unreliable Yamaha X45 prototypes. Thus, the climax of the movie is centered around[ **two men driving around in circles**](https://youtu.be/gfXns_cU8I8).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[A nice graphic of the chase](https://i.redd.it/l9u2l57axnp21.jpg)

**Here are my assumptions:**

* They averaged 45 MPH during the entire chase
* They covered 180 miles during the chase
* They circled the tiny Louisiana island an estimated 848 times.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is what I know:**

I know a lot because the movie tells us everything

1. The movie has a [**36% Tomatometer score**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1090759_deep_blue_sea), and it made [**$37 million at the international box office.**](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=deepbluesea.htm) Surprisingly, it has a [**7.6 rating on IMDb.**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149261/)
2. The X45 Yamaha prototypes have 20 gallon tanks and get 9 miles per gallon.  We learn this when JCVD says “Wow, the X45 Yamaha prototypes have 20 gallon tanks and get 9 miles per gallon.”
3. The rectangular island has a diameter of 360×160 feet and the best way to circle it on the jet ski is to stay 20 feet away from the shore (380×180 feet = 1,120 foot diameter). We learn this when Crazy Cajun Karl (Clint Howard) says “look for an island that is roughly equal to the size of a American foosball\* field….including the endzone. Make sure to circle twenty feet around the shore.”
4. The chase scene lasted four hours. I know this because during the scene JCVD yells “It’s almost been four hours and these X45 Yamahas are still running. What efficiency!”
5. The only person who can grab the “Spear of Destiny” is the man who fulfills a very specific prophecy. We learn this when Crawdaddy Kat (Kathy Bates) says “Only the man whose Yamaha jet ski runs of gas may grab the spear of destiny. He only can be stopped by a man who has run out of gas while riding the same exact Yamaha jet ski.”
6. The gas tanks were totally full. We know this because when Michael Myers and JCVD steal them, the gas station attendant says “Hey! I just filled them X45 Yamahas with gas!”
7. I know they circled the island because of the movies theme song, which peaked at number #78 on Billboard’s Hot 100 Charts in 1996. The song [**“Going in Circles” by Lit**](https://youtu.be/aFZtFoMX-EU), featured these lyrics “We’re going in circles, circles never stop because their infinite, much like Michael Myers.”

There you have it! JCVD and Michael Myers circled a tiny Louisiana island 848 times during their four-hour chase scene in *Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween.*

[Harmony Korine](https://i.redd.it/ka87sz3f8vp21.png)

I was first introduced to Harmony Korine last year during a class screening of [Gummo](https://thefilmera.com/2019/04/02/absurdity-within-america-the-films-of-harmony-korine/). No one in the class had seen the film before, and all of us had no idea what to expect. As the film went on, most of my classmates got more and more unsettled; during a particular scene involving spaghetti and a bathtub, a few people had to look away in horror. By the time the credits rolled, several students said, “Thank God.” A few people outside were talking about how much they disliked it, calling it exploitative and disgusting. All I could say then was that I thought I liked it, but I didn’t know why. Like the rest of his filmography, Harmony Korine’s *Gummo* is so separate from what most people think of as “cinema” that it’s easy to dismiss it as trash. Yet, under the initial reaction of shock that comes with watching *Gummo*, *Julien Donkey-Boy*, or Korine’s other feature films lies an almost sincere and kind empathy for the forgotten or ignored people of America: the poor, the drug addicts, the mentally handicapped, the bizarre and the absurd.

154,"I've seen nearly everything at this point, so it's rare for a film to really shake me up or legitimately shock me anymore, especially when it comes to violence. Occasionally, though, a director is able to get it just right and remind me that I'm not totally numb. What are some stand out scenes that had enough power to make you truly affected by the violence you were seeing?

&amp;#x200B;

Some off the top of my head---

Playground- &gt;!The final scene when the two boys murder the child. Though it's shown far in the distance, the screams and brutality really got to me. It made my stomach turn even more when I realized that it barely showed the extent of the murder of Jamie Bulger, that the film was clearly inspired by. The kids screams and the senselessness of it just left me feeling empty. !&lt;

Black Swan- &gt;!That fucking hangnail scene. I RARELY look away but I can NEVER watch that part. Even the sound effects make me squirm. !&lt;

The Killer Inside Me - &gt;!When Affleck smashes Jessica Alba's face in, it's Irreversible levels of queasiness, and frankly disgusting. The killing later of his wife, though not as extensively graphic, is just as sickening. !&lt;

From Hell- &gt;!The graphically realistic throat slashing. I'm surprised that got by the MPAA without edits.!&lt;

13 Reasons Why- &gt;!When she slits her wrists in the bathtub. I could only handle about a second before I looked away. The sound effects were enough. I've never had the balls to watch it fully.!&lt;

1,"I thought this would be relevant to the sub because so many people are confused about marketing a Hollywood film. 

Ken Miyamoto, Produced screenwriter, former Sony Pictures script reader/story analyst, former Sony Studios liaison
Aug 6, 2011 ·

When you read in the trades, or in various avenues of the media, that X film had X amount of dollars as a budget, they are only referring to all three phases of PRODUCTION (pre, shooting, and post).  

Here's the thing though that most people don't account for and/or don't understand.  

Marketing (this is the same as advertising) - It's unfair, and also a weak argument, to try to backlash a movie's success (or lack thereof) by saying, ""Sure, it made $200 million at the box office but spent half that in marketing!""  People think they are making a clever and educated argument, when they are in fact not.  Why?  First off, all studios have an annual projected marketing budget (like any business would).  This budget is branched off to all of the films that the studio is making and marketing that year.  So if they have some specialty films (dramas), they'll throw maybe some double digit millions (depending on the stars involved and depending on the marketing plan of the various demos and quadrants they want and need to hit) to each.  With the tentpole franchise films, they'll obviously allot a more sizable chunk of their marketing budget to each of their films.  Starting at or around $60 million and sometimes upwards of $100 million.  

Although be aware that these figures are NEVER released to the public, so if you read that X tentpole film that you hate spent $200 million in marketing, it's a false figure... whether its close to that amount or not.  It's an empty ""fact"" to argue with.  So here's the thing... it's not fair to really tag the marketing costs to a film's overall cost because the studio money that was allotted to it was going to be spent anyway if the film never came into existence.  The money has been accounted for before the film even debuts.  Thus, if the $200 million produced Chipmunks vs. Smurfs movie you HATE (and want to tarnish in the public eye) has garnered $350 million domestically, and your fingers are aching to go online to Aint It Cool News or some other fanboy site and trash the film's success by saying, ""Yeah but, it cost $100 million to market and X amount to distribute and X amount in hospital bills because it physically and mentally damaged viewers""... well, it's a weak argument.  Just don't go see the movie.  That's the biggest impact you'll make and the best argument you could offer.

There's more to this story though.  What people also don't account for is product placement.  Studios are garnering millions of dollars with each tentpole film by product placement.  Transformers made millions by showcasing Chevy cars as their character vehicles.  Now you add the millions paid to them by Mountain Dew, fast food chains, cell phones, computer companies, etc.  You're injecting more revenue into the equation to balance a studios profit margin.

THEN, you add the rights paid to the studio for streaming, VOD, Pay Per View, etc.  Then you add the profits of DVD, Blu-ray, Pay Per View, etc.

THEN you add what is currently the most pivotal avenue for studios... the foreign market.  Most people forget about that.  Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides ""only"" made just over $238 million domestically.  But it made a ridiculous amount internationally... ready... $798 million!  That's over $1 BILLION in world wide grosses.  But it cost $1 billion to markter, right?  LOL.

So, in closing, you can probably tell from my comments that a nerve was hit with this question.  I can think of no weaker argument that a person can make, in regards to their reaction to a piece of cinema (good or bad... but its a subjective medium people), than ""But it really wasn't a success because of the marketing costs and yada yada.""  

You don't sound smart saying that.  You are not offering an educated observation.  You're picking the weakest argument when you could be offering an intelligent subjective reaction to a film by telling people what you liked and what you didn't like... and why.  Discuss it.  Don't bash it because it didn't live up to your expectations.

3,"it sucked. i am pro life and all but holy shit what a bad movie. 

the acting was some of the worst ive seen in a while save the lead actress, and the story was so not believable. 

first the stupid fucking narration. one of the dumbest and most overused ways of exposition in movies, and only acceptable IMO when used sparingly and well done. which it wasnt in unplanned

second the storyline. i just dont believe that someone who went through such graining and tough experiences with abortion would want to work at planned parenthood, especially after her second, “chemical” abortion. it was such a jarring experience for her and she was angry at PP for lying about how it would happen and then she just gets over it? nah. 

third, the acting. while i did think the lead actress did as good a job as she could with the script and storytelling, but damn she didnt get a single shred of help. from her husband to the nurses to her parents and that stupid fucking lawyer at the end it was soooo bad. 

bad movie and i look forward to debating my religion teacher about it tomorrow. ",movies,watched the movie “unplanned” tonight,watched the movie “unplanned” tonight

10,"My nephew is purchasing tickets for us to try the new 4DX cinema experience for Endgame at the end off this month. Neither of us have watched a 4DX movie yet. It is my understanding that not only are there extra sensory inputs but the seats also articulate. I am a bit on the larger size and knowing that concerns me. I was wondering if anybody had tried the 4DX experience and if you could share what your experience was like. Do the seats move around as much as the ones in Soaring over California, from Disneys California Adventure, or just enough to follow the action in the movie? It is not motion sickness I am worried about just fitting into the chairs. Thank you for all who comment. I will try and respond to any comments or concerns as I am able. 

Also, is the experience worth the extra ticket price? Do you feel 4DX will become more widespread? What is the next step in the movie going experience you see happening? I was surprised to hear, after reading the website, that there are multi-projector screens that wrap around the theater. I also experienced, when I watched Captain Marvel, that the seats vibrated along with the action. I had never experienced such things before and am very excited to see what 4DX has to offer.

No, I have not been raised in a barn but have lived in areas quite removed from “civilization” for the last ten years and am still learning about what new things the world has to offer. Where I used to live our nearest Wal-Mart was two hours away in another state, there were no fast food or popular stores or restaurants. Everything was little mom and pop stores and the population was just over 2,000. We did have two sort of fast food chains about a block away from each other; Subway and Quiznos. You would think if any other chain would open they would open serving a different kind of food but apparently not. Unfortunately the Subway won the franchise wars and booted Quiznos out of the area.  Apparently we have enough long sandwiches to satiate the town with only one.

23,"The upcoming X-Men film Dark Phoenix has gotten a lot of pre release hate ever since it was first announced (And it amped up after the Disney/Fox merger was confirmed). But I actually have a good amount of hope for the film (Second most anticipated CBM of the year behind Joker for me) and here's why.

1. I'm glad they're adapting the Dark Phoenix storyline again- The Dark Phoenix story is great and has so much cinematic potential. They obviously tried adapting it in X-Men 3 (As a B plot) and it didn't really work out. So far IMHO, this looks like a much better adaptation of the story (And it will have a cosmic element this time).

2. James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender as Xavier and Magneto- The whole cast for this film is great (Jessica Chaistain, Nicholas Hoult, Even Peters, etc), but the 2 big guns to me are Mcavoy and Fassbender as Xavier and Erik and this will be our last chance to see them in these roles. They're 2 of the best actors working today and have crushed these roles in the previous 3 films (I actually think Mcavoy's performance in DOFP was kind of award worthy and that the scene in Apocalypse where Magneto's daughter dies is one of the best acted scenes in a CBM thanks to Fassbender). Plus it would be great for Fassbender to have another critical hit as he hasn't one since 2015 when Steve Jobs and Macbeth came out (Even though I personally find his Assassin's Creed movie highly underrated).

3. Good trailers- So far the trailers have gotten a mixed reaction, but I've personally enjoyed them. The first one was pretty good for a first teaser and the second one was fantastic IMO. I like the darker tone they're going for and the struggle our lead mutants will have (Do we try to save Jean grey from this Phoenix Force, or kill her?). Some people are saying it looks too similar to X3, but remember that in X3 the Dark Phoenix storyline was B plot to the mutant cure main story. In this film, DP actually is the central story.

4. Musical score by Hans Zimmer- What else can I say. It's Hans Zimmer scoring an X-Men film. The guy who scored The Dark Knight Trilogy, Man Of Steel, The Lion King, Pirates Of The Caribbean, The Ring, The Rock, Inception, The Last Samurai, Interstellar, Gladiator, 12 Years A Slave, Dunkirk, etc.

5. The end of a great era- This will be the last main X-Men film released in this franchise before Disney announces a reboot in the MCU a few years from now (Not very excited about that). This saddens me since I think Fox has done a fantastic job with all of their X-Universe films aside from X3 and Wolverine Origins (X-Men Days Of Future Past is also my favorite CBM of all time), and were willing to give us different kinds of comic book adaptations (Like DOFP, Logan, Deadpool, and Legion if you want to count TV) besides the usual Marvel formula will get out of Disney. But since we can't stop this merger, all I can do now is hope this film is good and ends the series on a high note with no major cliffhangers.

So there you go. I still believe this movie could end up being pretty good. I obviously won't know that for sure until I see it, but I still have hope. What do you think? Agree or disagree?

43,"First the elephant in the room is the massive amount of backlash from having Scarlett Johansson in the lead, but this was a film made by American studios with the hopes of reaching mainstream American audiences. 

Although the appeal for producers is obviously to reach some level of global acclaim, mostly in the east where massive profits are usually made in films like this (see pacific rim etc) the moviegoers overseas usually *never* have a problem with seeing white leads in an eastern themed film. 

The issue starts with American audiences, there are no big name Japanese actresses that could’ve filled this role and created a brand recognizable to American audiences. If we are being honest, having an all Japanese cast would’ve created the image of a “fringe” movie that most Americans wouldn’t care to see unless they were already interested in anime. 

From the point of view of the movie makers, they could cast a well known actress that would pave the way for a recognizable brand in the form of future movies (that catch the attention of Americans), and audiences overseas would still enjoy it because they have a history of using white leads in their own entertainment, as well as enjoying big budget American adaptations of similar content. 

Unfortunately I think it was a movie that was doomed from the beginning, if they had cast a Japanese actress in the lead then it would’ve done just as poorly in America simply because it wouldn’t have entered the ‘mainstream’. There was no way for the filmmakers to know there would be a whitewashing backlash, and with a history of Japan embracing similar adaptations it probably felt like the safest route for filmmakers to take.",movies,‘Ghost in the shell’ was a great movie and complaints of whitewashing created a lose-lose situation for filmmakers.,‘Ghost in the shell’ was a great movie and complaints of whitewashing created a lose-lose situation for filmmakers.

The movie looks absolutely unfunny, unoriginal, and just overall terrible. It’s like one of the most stereotypical dumb movies ever, like something that family guy would come up with. Like that scene in family guy where there’s a new tv show with Julia Louis Dreyfus and an elephant and she’s like “why don’t you wanna meet my parents?” And he’s like “maybe because your dad’s an ivory hunter?” And they both look at the camera and say “see? There’s a lot going on here”. This movie is like “what happens when the world’s bitchiest businesswomen...becomes a little girl?!? 😂” And it’s not even like drag me to hell where it’s some creepy gypsy that puts a curse on her it’s literally a little girl who waves a magic wand and says “i wish you were little” or some dumb shit like that.

For those who haven’t seen it it’s a story about two Japanese families from different social backgrounds who find out one day that their respective sons were switched at birth. The screenplay is so thoughtful, really made me think a lot about what exactly it means to be ‘family’, and even manages to find some very welcome humour in the margins. Kore-eda has a very unique sensibility as a director, he’s not showy but every choice of shot, dialogue, editing etc. feels perfect, and all performances are great, Masaharu Fukuyama as the father is particularly outstanding.

But I still stumble across what it really means.

Of course it has something to do with **white Fragility** and in general how white ""liberalism"" is also a cause for racism (the dad even tries to justify by saying he'd voted for Obama a third time) but I believe there is more to it.

It also makes an interesting statement about black people being **superior** to white people, as the white people in the film quite literally want to be inside a black mans body because he's strong or tall or handsome et cetera. This is also very cleverly painted by Peele in a way that every white character in the movie is essentially evil and every black character is good, or at least not evil. Therefore not falling for the trope of having one ""good/bad"" guy of a certain race in it.

It's somewhat helpful that the ""midnight"" releases have migrated to earlier and earlier in the evening these days, but that also means that the true opening night is always on a Thursday. Now I know, I know, not everyone works a M-F 8-5 job. But that is sort of... The norm. And it drives me absolutely crazy that our options are either to stay up all night on a weeknight and go to work exhausted or call out, or see every possible spoiler the day after the movie releases (because people are assholes, which is a whole separate issue). AND if you complain about this like I am, you get told you're not a ""true fan"" if you aren't willing to sacrifice your sleep or job for the movies.

TLDR: My boyfriend had to set an alarm for 4am today to buy Endgame tickets for our group and there was ONE showing earlier than 10pm, and it's a 3 hour movie, so we wanted to make sure we get that showing because it comes out on a Thursday.

0,"**The White Balloon** (1995) is an endearing family film from Iran, that features a young girl Razieh whose heart is set on getting a goldfish for the new year celebration.  But can she persuade her mother to agree?  And what will happen if she loses her money?  It's Persian language, so English speakers will need to rely on subtitles, but this won't prove a real obstacle given the sweet and simple story.

The plot is very simple, and the majority of the film is spent with Razieh  and her brother Ali sitting on the sidewalk, peering into a drain, and trying to get people to help them.  It's charming because it's so simple, and you view the action through the eyes of a child, which is the film's greatest strength.  There are hints of bigger dangers in the world in which they live, but as children, Razieh and Ali are mostly oblivious to these dangers.  For Razieh, her greatest fear is that gut-wrenching feeling of loss that comes when losing a banknote, and the film really makes her emotions become our own.

Not only does the film do a good job of dramatizing a slice of life as seen by the mind of a child, but it also gives some insights into Iranian culture, which give additional interest for Western viewers.  Another important message is about relationships with strangers, and how often it is only in times of trouble we turn to others.  As someone has observed, there is a point where all the characters who have interacted with Razieh cross the screen at the same time without any connection to each other.

The action is slow-moving, and modern teenagers won't likely be captivated by this film, given how it departs from the usual formulas of Hollywood.  The ending, for instance, is quite sudden and seems unsatisfying, as Razieh and Ali are no longer in focus, and the action freezes on the Agfhan boy and his white balloon after which the film is named.  This is surely deliberate, and it gives a hint that this boy has his own story and connections (he's also shown at the start of the film meeting Razieh's mother), even if we haven't yet discovered them; perhaps his need is even greater than Razieh's.

While I did enjoy the film, it lacked the charm and depth of other Iranian films like Children of Heaven and Color of Paradise, by director Majid Majidi.  If you enjoyed White Balloon, you will almost certainly love those other titles.

I’m looking for some good *serious* 80’s drama films. Movies like, *’The River’s Edge’* (1986), *’Colors’* (1988) and *’Clean &amp; Sober’* (1988). 
____________________________________________________________________

I want to show my other movie watching buds that there were legit heavy-dramas made in the 80’s and that not every film of that decade was a ‘Genre’ film. (Comedy, Sci-Fi, etc.)

Anyone got any recommendations for some heavy 80’s dramas?",movies,"What are some good, serious 80’s dramas?","What are some good, serious 80’s dramas?"

12,"Anyone else bothered by how nonchalantly everyone else in movies are treated like faceless grunts and how we're always supposed to be okay with them being sacrificed for the sake of one person?

I mean like how in movies and televisions shows when you have for example two characters that are in love, and then one of them gets kidnapped or whatever. And we're just supposed to be okay with the other person who's a leader sending in everyone else to die just to rescue one person and it's played of as this amazing thing.

But all that I can think of is how big of a dickhead the character is for doing that xD.

It just bothers me how movies and shows that are supposed to be realistic especially and be taken very seriously do that and expect us to just completely ignore that like 100 people died to save one person and that the '' hero '' made it all happen and we're supposed to be happy for the hero?

And the sacrifices aren't even so much as acknowledged at all.

Often they just forget that the others are supposed to be people, people with their own lives and their own stories.

But they just get thrown away so that we can get a heartfelt scene with sappy music where the hero and the lover are together again.

But all that I can think is '' you selfish fuck... ''.",movies,Anyone else bothered by this in movies and television shows?,Anyone else bothered by this in movies and television shows?

38,"Michael Bay’s movies were not terrible at all. Most of the his movies cracking a billion is a proof. A billion dollar mark is not easy for a movie that critics panned to death. 

Those movies had almost everything: humour, action, romance, characters, world building, interesting story. Everything general audience wants to see in a movie. 

I dont understand why people only like character driven movies. Whats wrong with rich stories and world building? Isnt that a filmmakers choice on how he wants to make a movie and should be judged as such. 

Bumblebee may be highest rated but made least amount of money. Humour was lame. I could follow the action in Bay’s movies too and also there always was a tension which wasn’t present in Bumblebee. 

I think for a Bumblebee movie the movie was fine. It suits the character driven narrative but if they are going to make every Transformers in its vein they will be making a mistake.

Spy Kids.

Back then, the spy kids, the heroes of a children's movie, had an uncle named [Machete](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete_(2010)). You all should know what came after this. I say this time they're pulling it off again, but with a long-term plan in mind. They'll soon release

Boots Kills

and

Boots Kills Again In Space!


Of course I don't expect them to stop here. There HAS to be a crossover movie with Machete and Boots called

Boot Knive.

This movie will then be the beginning of the Danny Trejo cinematic universe where every main character will be played or voiced by Danny Trejo.

They'll likely have some spinoff series on Netflix. However, they'll then pull them from there to make them exclusive to Robert Rodriguez' own streaming service Nachoflix which people first won't like, but accept later due to the sheer number of family friendly movies like Dora and Spy Kids.

In the end they'll buy Disnep and we'll finally get a Deadpool movie on the index due to too much gore. Also I expect Danny Trejo to play Peter Parker in the next Spiderman reboot.",movies,Boots from Dora and the future of Danny Trejo's movies,Boots from Dora and the future of Danny Trejo's movies

8,"There are plenty of examples, but 2 from the 73rd academy awards in 2001 irk me in particular:

Russell Crowe did not deserve best actor for Gladiator. I love Gladiator, and he did a fine job as Maximus, but there were numerous other actors in the movie that outshone him: Joaquin Phoenix (who lost to Benicio Del Toro in Traffic), Connie Neilson, Richard Harris, and Oliver Reed (even though some of his scenes were posthumous CGI) to name a few. As for the lead actor competition, he won over Tom Hanks for Cast Away. Tom Hanks, who made me cry when he lost a ball. I cry every damn time I watch that scene. For someone who was nominated for best actor 3 years in a row, I think his acting ability is overrated. He’s done some fine work, and he’s been given loads of great roles, but when you see him work alongside superior actors, it becomes more evident that he is not that great. For example, Jennifer Connolly easily outshone him in A Beautiful Mind, and was rightly awarded best supporting Actress. I recently watched Boy Erased, and it was abundantly evident that Nicole Kidman, while at times also a little overrated herself, was on a whole different level to Russell. 

Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb in Requiem for a dream lost out to Julia Roberts for Erin Brockovich. Julia also did a fine job, but it didn’t even come close to Ellen Burstyn’s portrayal as a lonely aging woman descending into prescription drug induced psychosis. She gave [one of the best monologues in movie history](https://youtu.be/clHCsZA0f6Y). Big mistake, Academy. Big.

Created by Jesse Armstrong (Peep Show/Thick of It), which staggered me!

It's a *wicked* drama with lots of infighting and scheming but it's nowhere near as *schlocky* as the blurb makes it seem, very polished.

I’m also trying to figure out the first western live action series that was adapted into anime. “Batman” and “Blade” were comics first before they were live action TV. Was there any other series or franchise before “Supernatural” that got adapted?

5,"I just finished watching the show, and I was a big fan of the film years ago. In comparing the two, it feels like the production team just read the script and didn't understand at all what made the movie unique.

It has been years since I have seen the movie, so forgive me if any of my recollection is wrong. The defining characteristic of the film was a mystical, fairy-tale like portrayal of the story. It was dripping with style. This is heavily due to the outstanding soundtrack, but also the character design. Hanna was a stone cold killer, contrasted with childish innocence. Erik was a caring yet aloof father figure with a mysterious past. Marissa was a sociopathically cunning evil queen. Then you have the quirky side characters, like the Hitman with his goons, and their accompanying whistle tune, or the mad-hatterish carnie who takes Hanna in. Even the color filters for different scenes gave everything a very consistent magical feel.

The show has none of these qualities. It feels ad-libbed in comparison, like they took the crew from Jack Ryan and said ""do the same thing, with a different script"". It felt like the 6th Jason Bourne movie. It completely ditches any attempt at style to just power through the plot. Erik and Marissa's actors were competent, but their characters were not well done. Erik has gone from being aloof and mysterious to having everything spelled out for you. Marissa went from the cruel ice-queen to a very generic redemption arc and incredibly ham-fisted abortion themes. 

Hanna's actress had zero charm. She went from innocent to basically autistic. I try not to judge younger actors too harshly, but when you're upstaged by someone 2/3rds your age, you got work to do. Flat as a board, robotic, bland, generic, insert more synonyms here. Even when she had a chance to properly emote, such as dancing at a party....suddenly a girl raised in a forest knows how to dance. A perfect chance to show off the character's innocence and naivety, and either the actress or the director choose the generic option. Her teenage coming-of-age scenes? Absolute filler-tier writing. I would rather watch Dawson's Creek. The star of the show is the most boring part of it. 

Oh, and those quirky characters that added to the Alice in Wonderland like feel of the original film? Only the hitman shows up, lacking his signature whistle or any style at all, and gets killed before you can get interested in him in the slightest. The carnie dude doesn't show up at all. 

I will be generous and say that if I had never seen the movie, I would probably not hate the show that much. Certainly nothing to write home about, but it'd fill a week's worth of after-dinner TV watching well enough while you wait for Game of Thrones to come out. However, simply the fact that they had such great source material to work with, and utterly discarded everything about it that made it unique, really shows the amateur hour that Amazon's production teams are at. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the film was the most amazing thing ever, but it was concise, had no fat on it, and had a definitive style. The show had none of this. 

I am now legitimately terrified at how the LotR show will turn out. ",television,"Amazon's ""Hanna"" completely missed the mark","Amazon's ""Hanna"" completely missed the mark"

10,"The Office is the funniest show ever to me, every episode (Michael Scott era) was off the charts hilarious to me. Naturally, after watching many times, I decided to watch P&amp;R. Loved every single episode. It was amazing. So, when I heard about The Good Place, I gave it a go, and am very into it now. All three are amazing shows, definitely in my top 10 shows. Then I hear about Brooklyn 99, and I can't contain my excitement. I watch an episode... wasn't into it. Which was strange, because the other three I was hooked from the very first episode. I figured I'd give it a shot, so I watch a few more. Not really feeling it. Eventually, I watch the whole season one, and, knowing that P&amp;R and the office improved after season one, was excited for season two. Found myself incredibly disappointed. I have laughed maybe once the whole time. Jake and Amy have zero chemistry compared to Jim&amp;Pam or Leslie&amp;Ben. I am deeply annoyed by several of the characters every time they appear because they're not funny at all. The writing is so formulaic. I try not to compare it to the others, but it so obviously is just taking characters and plotlines that worked from the the office and parks and rec, and redoing them. I really really want to like this show, but I just find myself cringing at how forced the jokes are.

75,"**I DONT WANT TO PROMOTE PIRACY BUT RATHER DISCUSS ABOUT A SERIOUS PROBLEM**

6-7 years ago Netflix was great because it gave people the ability to cut their cable tv. Now with every single company switching to subscription based plan it seems that people are experiencing subscription fatigue due to too many subscription based services.

Few days ago I was talking with few friends who also were long time Netflix subscribers (and some Amazon Prime vIdeo too) and while I was talking with them they said something which remained in my head forever, out of 7 friends, 6 of them decided overtime to cut all of their subscription based services and started pirating again. And the last one said that he will still be subscribed for some time. While I didn’t go to piracy, I canceled Netflix in favor of Amazon Prime Video and Hulu (I have it with Spotify) when Netflix increased it’s prices back in October or November.

My question is what do you think about subscription based video services because I think that it will return us into a golden age of piracy again. Netflix was great because it gave us the possibility to watch movies and tv series without paying too much but now that a lot of companies started pulling their content from Netflix it started to be overpriced. 

There are a lot of big players who still have to join this market and from what I see there’s already a fatigue in this market.",television,What do you think about every single company creating its own video streaming service with original content?,What do you think about every single company creating its own video streaming service with original content?

I'm mostly confused at the ending itself. I like the episode a good amount and still do, but don't think I quite understood the ending. I figured the entire time that the ""pilot"" didn't exist and he was just having a manic episode and nothing was really going on OR he was going crazy and did all sorts of things for the plane to actually crash. Then I suppose there really was a rogue pilot that crashed the plane and everyone somehow survived but Adam Scott since the passengers had enough of his shit from the fight and killed him. 

If the pilot crashing the plane was real, how did Adam Scott know the code was 1015 and why was everything 1015 in the first place? I think i'm just missing the point or there is just a little too much plot armor for my taste.

3,"Gotham is a brilliant show because it has numerous advantages that a lot of shows use-up 2-3 seasons in although still end up being renewed for no good reason, but within its fifth season which will be its final....Gotham has managed to provide the bestest combination of storylines within 40-45 minutes max of episodes since the fifth season began, it feels well-written and effort has definitely been put into getting around somewhat plot holes that sometimes writers choose to ignore and the writers let the show thrive with what they have. The show will only have five seasons when it’s finished yet numerous shows like Supergirl, Arrow and will be getting a new season, even though most their stories are teen-based. Sure, we all love some drama but when A show like Gotham is being such a pro at providing such stealthy and human characters with a realism on to personalities to its super villains along with well developed story arcs, it makes you wonder if today’s audiences truly love good tv or would rather just get lost in oblatory nonsense. Most of the superhero shows can not compare to Gotham, when watching Gotham I hardly ever roll my eyes because I can roll with whatever the character does or where ever the story goes because I know there will be an end result, but I just don’t see that in those other shows—clips tell me enough. There are times where characters have been around the block in their arc a two or more times though it may seem annoying, the outcome makes up for all of the rehashing and ends on a satisfying result. 

Gotham has had to suffer enough for being the most underrated show for so long...but the production and scripts have still kept up really well, for me, it hasn’t lost its touch of pleasing me at all.....

Gotham has by far the best soundtrack in a TV show for me. All the music is made by Bruno Heller. I listen to almost every soundtrack from the show and it’s so satisfying. The writing and creation of each soundtrack is really specific, from the character segments to the major scene moments, the music is the biggest pro of the show above everything else. They deliver mood and tone to each scene. 

I’m not really a fan of the Batman mythos but i used to watch the animated series as well as that Batman and Robin Movie way back when, thanks to Gotham I can now see those characters something to watch and know they’ve gotten to a place they’ve earned that’s what Gotham does. It’s a city that changes people, it’s unique: the show itself portrays that without watering it down to “CW level” with cringe humour and romance as well as the soundtrack that helps carry the tension and hype for each moment followed by the constant to risks the show takes, it’s no wonder Gotham is the most underrated show on TV, people just don’t want good TV—they can teen relatability that people can laugh at with Witty humour and overthetop representation with sexism and real-world PCs. Gotham is timeless it’ll never be forgotten in my eyes.

20,"I've been rewatching Lost recently, with a little bit of The Last Kingdom on the side, and aside from having fantastic stories with great characters, what struck me most about these shows is the world they take place in. Both are settings that I just lose myself in, and they feel like real universes that exist even without the shows taking place there (well, in the case of The Last Kingdom, I guess it actually does lol).

Lost manages to create this aura of mystery and awe around the Island but as the show goes on, we learn more about its history, with the Dharma Initiative and the Others and some of the other more crazy twists, and it just makes it seem more and more like a complete, fleshed out universe.

And although The Last Kingdom is based on historical places and concepts, it still does an excellent job of actually bringing that setting to life, and really creating a grounded, earthy middle-ages world.

Game of Thrones is obviously one of the best at this as well, and adaptation of Westeros is probably one of the best examples of worldbuilding on TV,

I have another lesser-known example, and that's the 90s comedy-drama Northern Exposure, about an American doctor from NYC moving to a small town in Alaska. It was really able to create a charming, whimsical Arctic atmosphere that you love spending time in.

Now luckily for me and any other self professed critics like us there is no shortage of,good television. From netflix to cable, to HBO to prime, shows are being put out faster than i can count. Some of My alltime favorties : The wire, game of thrones, Fargo, breaking bad ect. I like a good story, good acting and a witty script,. Not all shows have all 3 but if they can keep me entertained with 2 out of the 3 then i usually still watch without,complaint. See im more the type to commend a show then to come out complaining about one. Butt recently hannah drove me nuts. The show started out awesome. I mean literally first 4 episodes were awesome. While the series itself had good acting, good compelling story and a decent script. Kept me on,edge bingeing until all of a sudden it became lol bad. It was like the director handed the reigns,over. To his 3 year old son at sone point. Which sucks because up until thaf point i was an actual fan. Now id like to vet others opinions but to be a little more,specific.. I thought hanahs later fight scenes like 7th episode. Umm the girls in the program made no sense , could not act and just made it hard to take serious i mean just the ending in General was awful to,a,show i felt sarted very strong.

3,"Just watched them. Very well done. Basically Peele made mini ""Get Out / Us"" films in a sort of roundabout way. I was very happy with the way they were done and the nods to the originals. But twisted to fit this era. Acting and actor choices were spot on. 

Now. What most of the people are pissed about. A new subscription. Listen, I get it. People are so used to Network TV and it being free. Buck up people. I was wondering how he was getting some larger names to drop into these shows. Now we know. They are getting paid. And they need to recoup some of that talent cost.  It's not the end of the world. 

My guess : They will be editing these so that this summer or whenever they will show them on CBS. Just not in full form. Cant say those words on basic cable. This is CBS going after the HBO crowd with some premium stuff. If the quality turns out like this, I am in. Just like the movies folks. They are looking to profit.

I am not saying I am for that formula. I am simply saying they put out a quality (at least these two) program that was a very well done nod to the past (IMHO).

As we all know, we are living in the golden age of television with quality content coming practically from our ears, so this has attracted great writers and directors to create shows and amazing actors, primarily known from movies, to appear in them, such as Anthony Hopkins, Chris Pine, Julia Roberts, Jessica Lange, Nicole Kidman, Jim Carrey etc.  (Al Pacino, Ethan Hawke, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, Anne Hathaway &amp; Russell Crowe all appearing in upcoming shows).

Here's I think should do TV; John Cusack, Nicolas Cage, Emilio Estevez, Edward Norton, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke. (Mostly because I think these are good actors and should be given great material.)

And here's who I want to do; Willem Dafoe, Vincent Cassel, Gary Oldman &amp; Robert De Niro

I don’t have a favorite character, they all are perfect in very way.  

It’s strange but, I have to watch this one alone.  Because of the time I watch it for the first time, I was going through a difficult time in my life.  This brings me back to my emotional state, although it was a dark time, it feels a bit of comfort in a way.

Seasons 4-6 were the hypermusical cringefest I was hoping to avoid.

Seasons 1-3 on the other hand, were actually pretty good.

- The cast/characters had this strange charisma that just hooked me into the show for some reason.

- Several of the moments in the show had amazing and very believable acting.

I was literally obsessed with finishing the first 3 seasons to the point where it was all I looked forward too.

25,"Sex is just incredibly awkward to watch. Mind you it's not the nudity. I habe never felt uncomfortable with nudity itself, but it's fucking weird to watch constant, unnecessary and forced sex scenes. I'd rather not.

Romance as a concept is fine. It's just that so often it's forced. "" Oooh girl and boy equals sex and kisses yay"" is basically the chemostry between the characters. This too is forced, adds nothing to the plot and is cringey as fuck to watch. And its a shame because you can do it right. In Lucifer Lucifer x Chloe, in B99 Jake x Amy or Holt x Kevin, in the 100 Bellamy x Echo or Murphy x Ontari, in Titanic Jack x Rose or in BNHA Deku x Ochaco or Bakugo x Kirishima (Neither of these are canon but come on we all know the truth). So it can be done right, it's just usually not. It's incredibly frustrating to watch 2 people with no chemistry to get together just for the sake of it. Id rather watch paint dry.

That said, I also highly dislike love triangles and general relationship drama over petty things. I also hate watching affair/cheating storylines. That's mostly because it's incredibly boring and just makes me hate the cheater, even if they're the protagonist. I could never forgive someone for something like that, so those characters can go die for all I care.

There can be interesting drama for sure. I reallt like Lucifer x Chloe. The drama stems from the fact that Lucifer is the literal devil and tries to cipe with that. It's new and interesting. At least more fun to watch than ""oof karen took the kids :("" ",television,I hate sex and romance on almost any tv show,I hate sex and romance on almost any tv show

It feels a bit like Sherlock. This is ostensibly set in the real world but disbelief is not just suspended but hanged from the neck until dead. 

Is the rest of the show the same or does the writing improve? And yes I know this is a bit of a loaded question and taste is subjective and some people really like the show. ",television,Does Luther get better?,Does Luther get better?

I took precious time off to watch this and it's just incredibly slow, boring and very unlike the previous seasons, without getting into much detail. Besides the pacing and plot, I have some extra complaints about the animation and action which seems to have taken a step down in quality from previous season. Also, most of the fun and light-heartedness is gone except for your quota of typical superhero quips, it's tonal inconsistencies are as bleak and jarring as the current live action DC stuff, even S2 at the height of it's despair of an alien invasion/takeover felt more hopeful, colorful and exciting than this one, which feels like its just going through the motions and using it's new higher maturity rating for being edgy for the sake of being edgy

9,"So I stopped watching The Walking Dead around the start of season 7 when Negan first appeared. The general consensus seems to be that seasons 7 and 8 were pretty garbage so it doesn't seem like I've missed much.

I've been reading, however, that the show has really picked up again in season 9 so I'm considering jumping back in. My question is do I need to watch the last two seasons to appreciate/make sense of season 9, or can I just skip straight to season 9 and just read a quick recap of the last two seasons?",television,Jumping back in to The Walking Dead,Jumping back in to The Walking Dead
31,"EDIT: THIS IS MY OPINION. Just in case that isn't incredibly obvious.

I've been rewatching Barry in preparation for the season two premiere this weekend. I immediately fell in love with this show when it first aired and was absolutely floored by how amazing it is across the board. Everything from the writing, directing, acting, storytelling, action, drama, comedy are all absolutely top-notch. Even the attention to detail regarding firearms goes to a level few TV shows and movies ever bother with. Every episode of this show is great in part due to both the brevity of each episode and the brevity of the season as a whole. Coming in at about 30 minutes per episode and eight episodes total, the story is constantly moving forward in a significant way. There are no lulls or downtime. Nothing feels extraneous. You're constantly invested from beginning to end.

However, I think episode seven captures the essence of the show better than any other episode and is an absolute masterclass in storytelling, all the while being very meta when it comes to acting without coming across as pretentious. I can't think of any other show or movie that so nimbly shifts between straight-up comedy, dark comedy, action, drama, tragedy and back again as expertly as Barry does, and although this show does this so flawlessly throughout S1, no episode demonstrates its ability to do so better than E7. After finishing the first season again a couple days, I've now watched E7 four times in the last two days. It's that good. **SPOILERS AHEAD**

__________________
**My bags are packed, I'm ready to go...**
_______________

We pick up right where E6 left off at the airstrip in which Barry found himself in an ill-prepared ""bumrush"" on the Bolivian Cartel Boss's plane thanks to the idiocy of the somehow affable psychopathic meathead, Taylor. Unsurprisingly, the strategy *does not work* and doesn't even come close to working, as the Bolivians see them coming from a mile away and shoot up the car before they can get anywhere near the plane. We see Taylor and the other ex-Marine get shot and killed before the car flips over, leaving the fate of Barry and his other ex-Marine buddy, Chris, a mystery to end E6.

E7 starts with this same scene, except its from the perspective of the Bolivians at the other end of the airstrip. A strange tone is set from the get-go with John Denver's lovely ""Leaving on a Jet Plane,"" easing us into the scene, which is quite the odd contrast to the visceral and horrifying way E6 ended. 

But then the comedy kicks in *right away*. The two Bolivian hitmen hear Taylor's car coming, blasting some sort of death metal music and making themselves incredibly obvious. The Bolivians exchange silent stares between each other, confused and in disbelief that someone coming to kill them would make it this easy. Although we know what's about to happen, it's hard not to laugh as what we already knew to be a clearly terrible strategy (the bumrush) is shown in a comedic light from their POV. They shoot up the car and the car flips over.

&gt; *""Have you read The Four Agreements?""*

Then we meet the Bolivian Cartel boss, Cristobal Sifuentes. And it turns out, as Goran tells NoHo Hank in this scene, Cristobal is actually a *super nice guy.* It's not that he's a super nice guy in the same way that say, Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds is a super nice guy (i.e., his nice guy persona is a tool he uses to get and maintain control over a situation/person). No, Cristobal is *legitimately* a super nice guy and this revelation stands in such stark contrast from what we came to expect in earlier episodes that it is hilarious in and of itself. It only gets funnier when Cristobal calls Goran and Goran comes to the same realization: that the Bolivian crime lord he was told was a bloodthirsty maniac is in fact a *super nice guy* and was more than willing to work with Goran and actually *admired* the threat he made by mailing a bullet. The conversation becomes even more amusing when Cristobal professes to Goran how great the self-help book, *The Four Agreements* is and recommends it to him. Goran, now aware of how badly he fucked up, suggests they start over. Unfortunately for him, Cristobal stands by his people and perhaps reluctantly tells Goran that the failed bumrush means war.

&gt;*""So yeah, it's a war now.""*

______________

**Barry and Chris, Part 1**
___________

We then catch up with Barry, who has managed to escape with his life and is hiding next to an old rundown car when his phone rings, alerting the Bolivian hitman to his location. The Bolivian is about to kill him when Chris saves Barry by shooting the hitman. Chris hesitates to shoot and only does so when Barry repeatedly pleads and yells for him to do it. After he fires the gun, Chris is noticeably shaken up by taking another man's life, but Barry doesn't give him any time to think on it, urging him to run before someone else shows up.

Only a few minutes into this episode, it has already demonstrated what this show does better than anything else on TV or in movies. We started with a comfortable and somewhat serene opening with a John Denver song, instantly shifted to action with the Bolivians shooting up the car, instantly shifted to comedy with Cristobal and Goran and then closed out the opening with a serious and traumatic moment for Chris that absolutely devastates and shatters him. Somehow -- *somehow* -- this wild rollercoaster makes perfect sense tonally within the confines of the show.

**""Are you on drugs, Barry? Because getting clean is an important part of an actor's journey.""**

_________

Barry shows up to the final rehearsal of Macbeth fresh from his near-death experience. Scatterbrained and still full of adrenaline, Barry completely flubs the one line he has, causing Henry Winkler's character, Gene Cousineau, to call for a break. He tries to lecture Barry and in doing so delivers what I think is the absolutely funniest, laugh-out-loud line in the show (and that's saying something, because there are a ton of them).

&gt; Are you on drugs, Barry? Because getting clean is an important part of an actor's journey. A little story to illustrate: **I was doing Long Day's Journey into Night at the Pasadena Playhouse with a bunch of coke heads. It's usually about a three-hour play. We could bring it in at just under thirty-seven minutes.** We thought we were great! Apparently, we were unintelligible. It was the beginning of the bad years, Barry. 

Gene wraps up the small lecture by telling Barry that if he can't deliver that one line, then maybe acting isn't for him. Barry already has a whole lot to deal with so the prospect that the one thing giving him hope in life -- acting -- might not be for him is a devastating suggestion.

_______
**Barry and Chris, Part 2**
________

&gt;*""I told you to get out of the car, man.""*

And then we get to the most emotionally and morally taxing moment of the series so far. Despite the laughs we've already had in this episode alone, we come to a scene that is absolutely heart-wrenching. Barry meets with Chris at Chris's request. Chris is freaking out. He can't get over the fact that he killed another human being. He explains that unlike Barry, Taylor and the other ex-Marine, he never saw combat. Also unlike the other three, Chris has a family -- a wife and child. He can't process the guilt he feels, both for the act itself and the secret he's keeping from his family. 

Barry tries desperately to calm him down because Barry knows what he probably has to do, he just *really, really, really* doesn't want to do it. He tries to point out that Chris saved Barry's life by killing the Bolivian. He tells him that if he doesn't keep his mouth shut and goes to the police, the Chechens will find him and kill his family. But Chris thinks going to the police will clear his conscience. Again Barry tries to dissuade him, saying that if he goes to the police, the police will inevitably find him, too. 

Chris, however, won't be swayed. He firmly declares he's going to the police regardless of what Barry thinks or plans to do. He doesn't realize it at first, but Chris just signed his own death warrant.

&gt;*""WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?!""*

Chris soon realizes the consequence of what he just said. Another vehicle pulls over near them and the driver and passenger switch seats. Barry waits for the car to leave so he can kill Chris with no witnesses. Chris recognizes that he's only still alive because of that other car and quickly tries to talk his way out of it, telling Barry that he told his wife he was going to meet with him, by insisting he's changed his mind and won't go to the police after all, and that they can just forget this ever happened.

The car pulls away. A brief moment of still silence. Chris tries to convince Barry not to do anything crazy; that he knows Barry is a good guy. Barry quickly pulls out his gun and kills Chris, his last words a plea for his life.

&gt;*""No, wait!""*

This scene is so emotionally powerful every time I watch it. It's so dark and depressing and follows what are essentially a string of mostly comedic scenes, yet the flow from comedy to this scene somehow *works.* You can feel the weight of Chris's guilt from the beginning and you can similarly feel the weight of Barry's guilt as he wrestles with what he knows he has to do, the weight growing and growing with every word Chris utters until it becomes too much and Barry pulls the trigger.

_______
**My lord, the queen is dead.**
________

Bill fucking Hader. I've always been a huge fan of his and over the years have seen plenty flashes of brilliance in his acting ability, but holy shit does Barry show that he is likely one of the best actors in the business right now. 

Barry retreats to a fantasy while he gets an Uber ride back to the theater in which he's dressed in full costume and delivers his one line, ""The queen, my lord, is dead,"" in an overdramatic fashion and English accent. When he actually arrives at the theater, Sally is anxious due to the talent agents in the crowd and begs Barry to not fuck up his one line. Once again, Barry is distracted and scatterbrained and doesn't listen.

Sally goes on stage while the emotional toll of Chris's murder crashes over Barry like a goddamn tidal wave. He keeps seeing images of himself pulling the trigger, Chris pleading for his life, Chris's family (that Barry met, by the way) and the phone call he imagines Chris's wife receiving to tell her of Chris's death. It causes a total emotional breakdown in Barry as he paces and grunts and punches a wall just when it's time to deliver his line.

Not only does Barry kill it, but Bill Hader *fucking kills it.* With real tears streaming down his face, he slowly walks on stage and delivers the line with such emotional authenticity that it captivates not only the audience in the theater, but we the audience watching it on screen as well. Barry kills it on stage, Bill Hader kills it on screen. This one line is so well-delivered that it changes everything. Sally drops her bad English accent for the closing monologue and acts from the heart, using Barry's excellent delivery to act in a way she hasn't before. Barry, meanwhile, slinks somewhere private to deal with his very real emotional trauma and guilt.

_________
**Back to the comedy! Wait, how?**
________

Once again, the show somehow follows all of this very serious and very emotional drama by jumping *straight back into comedy.* Gene Cousineau finds Barry backstage, heaping tons of praise on him. 

&gt; Barry, I saw you go to a place I've never seen you go before.

Barry yells at the top of his lungs and punches a framed photo on the wall. Gene is shocked and slowly begins backing away.

&gt; Okay, I see you're still in that place, so I'm going to leave you to your process.

Not only does the show jump straight back into comedy, but it uses the same serious, emotionally traumatic event we're still dealing with to do it. Considering the gravity of the event and how Barry/Bill Hader used it to pull out an absolutely incredible moment of dramatic acting, turning on a dime to use that same event and fallout for a joke shouldn't work tonally. But it does. And it's fucking hilarious.

___________
**Do we like Barry? Should we?**
____________

&gt; *""I'm a good person.""*

Murdering Chris is the moment of the story so far where we have to question how we think of Barry. Prior to Chris, we could buy into Barry as a pretty textbook antihero. He's an ex-soldier, a hitman with a conscience, naive and manipulated by his only ""friend,"" and honestly believes the people he's being paid to kill are legitimately bad people the world is better off without. So yeah, although Barry kills people, he either is, in fact, killing bad people or at least *believes* he's only killing bad people. 

We even see that he's hesitant to kill Ryan in the first episode after learning that Ryan is just a nice guy who hasn't actually done anything worth dying for. He still plans to go through with it (reluctantly) but is saved from having to do it by the Chechens. In other words, by not having to kill Ryan, we as viewers can still be on board with Barry...up until this episode. 

Killing Chris was all about self-preservation. Even worse, it shows that Fuches, despite being a manipulative piece of shit, was right all along. If Barry had listened to his advice and killed Taylor after the stash house raid, Chris never would've been roped into the job. He never would've gone to the airstrip, he never would've shot another person, he never would've wrestled with his conscience and threatened to go to the police, and Barry wouldn't have had to kill him.

But Barry could've done something about it much sooner. Barry doesn't kill Taylor for two primary reasons, 1) Taylor is a fellow Marine and 2) Taylor saves Barry's life at the stash house. However, just like the situation above, if Barry had listened to Fuches, he never would've been in a position where he had to decide whether to kill Taylor. Had he not gotten himself wrapped up in the acting class, socialized and joined Facebook, Chris never would've found Barry's Facebook profile, Barry never would've met Taylor and Taylor never would've found his plans for the stash house raid (I'm aware in this scenario Barry would've most likely killed Ryan and he and Fuches would've left LA, but still). 

* Side note: part of me really wishes they didn't kill off Taylor so soon. Despite being a psychopathic killer, I found him oddly affable (like every character in this show) and found some of his lines to be absolutely hilarious, specifically all the voicemails he left Barry. ""Hey Barry, it's Taylor. You kill those Bolivians yet? Let me know. Kill people. Fuck yeah.""

All of Barry's bad decisions lead up to this moment where he must kill a totally innocent man who never wanted to harm another human being -- a man Barry knew personally, a man with a wife and son *who Barry has met.* Since we as the audience do get some background on Chris (namely his family) and enough time with him to see he's just a nice dude, it really shows us something about Barry when he kills Chris just to protect himself. We can at least *try* to somewhat rationalize Barry's past murders. He was killing bad guys, drug lords, drug dealers, maybe other hitmen and gang members, etc. But this we cannot rationalize. And as if to make it worse, Barry goes on with the ideal life he always dreamed of in episode 8, forging an actual romantic relationship with Sally and becoming a legitimate stage actor. Basically, Barry murders Chris so he can live out his dream and run away from the sins he committed to get there, leaving an innocent widow and fatherless child in his wake.

Holy hell was it good.

Totally different from what I expected. It is an animated Black Mirror/Twilight Zone style show and different episodes have different animantion styles with each episode only being between like 8-18 minutes long.

The first episode alone was just mind blowing. Firstly that animation is so good that I had to take a second to make sure it wasn't real (a few episodes are like that). 

But big disclaimer, it is as TV-MA as I think I've ever seen. And I don't think it is used just for the sake of doing it. Like they want to capture the unfiltered reality. But I had some moments where I was thinking ""wtf am I watching happen?"" And that is one of the reasons it's so good.

Bottom line, I say at least watch the first episode. And the second episode is hilarious and no where near as brutal and gives a good dynamic for how the episodes can fluctuate.",television,"I just watched Netflix's ""Love, Death, and Robots"" last night and was blown away.

Anybody remember this show?  I know a lot of you are probably too young to have watched it during it's run.  And you guys missed out, man.


I'll admit, a LOT of episodes are cheesy by today's standards.  And many of them are very dated.  But I actually dig that, since the show is like a little time capsule of the 90's.  BUT, several episodes still hold up extremely well, and are still very compelling.  

The atmosphere is unlike any show I've seen, before or since.  Half the episodes were filmed in Paris, and half in Vancouver.  And the Paris episodes especially, just gave the show such a rich, historic and almost creepy feel to them.  

And the plot, it's brilliant.  There is SO much that writers can do with that storyline.  A immortal living throughout the centuries, fighting other immortals, being part of history?  You can do anything with that.  This show actually got me very interested in history, and the historical events they recreated were extremely accurate and well done.

And I loved that they took a realistic look at what immortality would be like...and in many ways it would be horrible.  It drove some immortals insane, others became depressed, and some became shut-ins avoiding making any relationships at all, because every mortal they knew or cared about would die eventually.  The show got pretty deep sometimes.  

Anyway, just wanted to rant a little about one of my all time favorite shows, and see if you guys have seen it.....and if so, what do you think of it?

129,"Listen, I was *mostly* willing to ignore the fact that everyone on your ship was obsessed with pop culture from the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  I mocked it a little, but mostly... fine.  Seth MacFarlane likes pop culture reference humor, and trying to invent futuristic artwork that doesn't feel incredibly fake is tough, so fine.

But don't also tell me that the lives of people in the late 20th and early 21st centuries are just a MYSTERY!

Don't tell me that your ship can recreate New York City on VJ-Day, 1945, but that your expert in historical humans doesn't know what ""WTF"" means.

After that, I started watching Boston Legal and lo, in Season 2 , Monica Potter, Lake Bell (she left in S1) and Rhona Mitra leave too. Although they might not seem important, they had excellent chemistry with the cast and some ladies with James Spader. I can't stand Julie Bowen or even take her seriously as a lawyer in S2 (She is great in Modern Family though). At least, the show is still entertaining due to Spader and Shatner.

If you do get into or are on the fence about it, I just wanted you to know I thought episodes 5 and 6 were one of the greatest 1-2 punches of character development and feels I’ve seen in a hot minute! As one YouTube comment put it, “I didn’t get a permission slip for this feels trip.”

Wayne is produced by a/the writer of Deadpool, Paul Wernick, and written by Shawn Simmons. It’s an east coast road trip, action-comedy with big bold music and great supporting cast, most of which deserve their own spinoff. Also, each episode has some of the most positive YouTube comments sections I’ve ever seen.

If anyone her decides to or has watched it, let me know what you think! No spoilers please, like I said I still have one episode left.

***Edit with no spoilers*** So, I just finished the show! the last scene totally had a cool extra detail with subtitles on. The show was amazing. I thought the ending was great, and I thought the whole fucking show was great. Really enjoyed the episode *Del* and the episode that followed, *Who Even are We Now?* (5 and 6 that i mentioned above).

9,"I made it through about 45-60 minutes of the first installment, only to turn it off in frustration. I had no knowledge of this prior to seeing this, and I was expecting a true documentary, in the genre of true crime. What I got, was  a propaganda film. So, I tried to read about the case by other means, now that my curiosity was piqued. ( If you care, I'll write what I found and my thoughts at the bottom. )

&amp;#x200B;

The documentary introduces you to the major players in the story, the way a standard TV show might do so. It's a slow build and gives you insight into Hae and Adnan's family life. While it could have been condensed, it's really puts personal in depth spin on the young teenager's lives and romantic involvement. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I really didn't like was the way the documentary seemed to mess with the timeline of events. The murder and it's evidence seemed as if it were an after thought. For example, we see Adnan's family in present time, grief stricken, and for some reason we spend some time with his sister in law and people trying to prove his innocence before we see anything about the murder, and facts about the case. I realize this a part one, to a three part series and you should too. They are in NO hurry to tell a story here and you are getting a story. This is not ""Making a Murderer"" (season 1), or any one of the ""Paradise Lost"" documentaries, where they present each side of the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Case against Adnan Syed has an agenda, when and if you watch, you'll see what I mean. And when you read articles about the documentary, and the audio documentary ""Serial"", you'll see what I mean. In the short time I watched Part 1, they were already seeding other theories that led you away from Adnan, without so much as talking about the evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, this is more of a melodrama, a biography on Adnan and his star crossed romance with his victim. He was convicted of Hae's murder and the evidence against him is solid and strong.

[https://app.box.com/s/fpdtx0y9yj3ps6u61ioh6ylfezzfxm6u](https://app.box.com/s/fpdtx0y9yj3ps6u61ioh6ylfezzfxm6u)  

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, when you read some articles about either the TV or audio documentaries, they attack the evidence, and Jay Wilds in particular, while over looking the corroborating testimony of others, facts and evidence.

The Documentary even goes so far as to attack the man who discovered Hae's body, bringing up indecent exposure arrest and subtly implying he could be a killer. With ZERO evidence to suggest it. ( I've had to walk 100 feet into some brush to be 100% certain no one could see me when I have had to go. Look, I like to use a bathroom, but when I have to go, I have to GO and people will call the cops if they see you peeing, even in the woods. Maybe Sellars didn't need to go in that far, maybe he likes to jerk off out in the woods. That doesn't make him a murderer and the Police did look into him. He had no connection to the victim and as far as anyone could tell he was nowhere near her.) But, the documentary seemed intent of pushing suspicion on him, anyway.

11,"Do you think it would ultimately hurt television if directors or actors put clauses in their contracts so that it limits the ability of the producer(or whoever decides these things) to give the show time to do a proper ending?  Like depending on the number of episodes in a season they would have to give the show a heads up at the halfway mark whether they would be renewed or not instead of after the season is over. Im just afraid it would make for even more premature cancellations if a show wasn't a hit out of the gate.  We wouldn't have shows like Breaking Bad for example.  Another idea I had was lets say a show has been on for two seasons.  At the third season mark they should be allowed to give a proper ending since its an established show that people are probably invested a that point. 

There are tons of great shows like Happy Endings and Pushing Daisies that were canceled prematurely without proper endings. ",television,"One of my biggest pet peeve concerning television, whether it be cable or streaming service, is when they decide to cancel a show without warning.

I am in awe of David Renwick. Sure, some of the episodes are not that brilliant. However, no matter the episode, he has done a fucking bang-up job of weaving the plot together. It is probably one of the best 'mystery' shows to ever appear on TV.

The show plays an important role in TV history too, I guess. Until now, I didn't realise that Hugh Laurie originally accepted the part for Jonathan but ended up turning it down as he couldn't work out the motivation. Oh, and the fact that Antony Stewart Head randomly disappears (he accepted the role of Giles and could no longer appear on Creek)

If you haven't seen it, you need to watch this show. It is one of the rare mystery shows where you won't know the solution unless you have seen the episode, but once you have seen it, you can easily go back through the episode and see all the little clues that you missed",television,In awe at David Renwick's writing on Jonathan Creek,In awe at David Renwick's writing on Jonathan Creek

35,"This may seem a little random, but I've been watching most of Star Trek: The Next Generation for the first time and I came across this episode in season 7 and for being an episode on a final season of a show, it stands out to be in a way that surprised me. This episode to me is fantastic even if you are not a star trek fan or anything. What I'll say below is **spoilers** to be sure, so just be aware.

It stands as such a depressing, but real episode. The series sometimes made me feel like they were afraid to kill characters that made an impact, but in this episode you feel like you get to know younger members of the enterprise and their evaluations by senior members; These same senior members who we have come to know throughout the show. We see real interaction with friends with these characters who we are only introduced to at the beginning, but by the end of the episode they seem almost fully fleshed out. Then we see one who is given a secret mission which is dangerous, but even watching it, you feel hopeful somewhat. Then as she leaves you acknowledge that this feels like it's going to go poorly. Then the reveal of her death....we don't see it. We only know that it happens and have to see Picard announce it to a crew made of her friends. This young woman went on a mission with someone who you would consider to be an enemy because she wanted to prove herself, but even more because she believes the cause.

It stands as a very human episode to me, that is worth watching even if you are not a fan of Star Trek. It is simply one of my favorite episodes.",television,"The Star Trek: TNG episode ""Lower Decks"" may be one of my favorite episodes of a TV show I've ever seen.","The Star Trek: TNG episode ""Lower Decks"" may be one of my favorite episodes of a TV show I've ever seen."
41,"There are plenty of legitimate reasons to stop watching a TV show, that's certain. But I think that there are also illogical reasons we stop watching them too, so I'm curious as to some of those reasons. 

Mine is the show Friends from College on Netflix. I heard average things about it so I decided to give it a whirl. Either at the end of the first or second episode, two people are taking a caged rabbit in a car somewhere (I forget where. maybe the vet?). They slam on the brakes, the rabbit somehow flies out of the cage to hit the inside of the windshield, and dies. It's played for comedy of course, and if it had been any other animal I honestly would have been fine. But I owned a rabbit a while back that we had to give away, and even though I know it was a TV show and it was fake, seeing the rabbit killed that way immediately removed any desire for me to finish the show. It really makes no sense because I've owned other animals and if it had been one of those that had hit the windshield it wouldn't have made a difference but something about it being a rabbit made it personal haha. 

Anyways, what about everyone else? ",television,What's the most irrational reason you've stopped watching a TV show?,What's the most irrational reason you've stopped watching a TV show?
75,"I’ve been watching Gotham recently (guilty pleasure show) and noticed that the set and costume designers do an excellent job of making the show feel timeless, in that you can’t actually place it in a specific time period, yet the world feels realistic. Some characters wear costumes that feel like they come from 60s, others from the 70s, 90s, or even today. The characters have flip phones but policemen and women use typewriters. And somehow it all feels natural, nothing seems weird or out of place. I find this incredibly impressive and wanted to find more shows that manage to pull something like this off. Does anyone know any shows that feel as though they could be taking place in anytime (whether by mixing and matching things from time periods like Gotham, or doing something else) and feel natural and realistic?",television,What are some TV shows that do a great job of feeling timeless?,What are some TV shows that do a great job of feeling timeless?

8,"I can still remember watching YTV's in-between/lead-in program with Snit (the purple TV thing made of gum) and Phil, and they were hyping up one night's upcoming episode of *Reboot*. They just straight up spoiled that Bob was finally returning. It was incredible to see this happen in the episode itself. They handled it really well, IIRC. Saved it for the very end of the episode. After all that time, his arrival really packed a punch.

Also, that period of *Reboot* is ingrained in my memory because, prior to Enzo losing an eye, the show was something I'd simply watch to wile away a bored Saturday afternoon or whatever. But I never really liked it deep down. Just found it mildly interesting.

That changed after Mainframe gets cast into some sort of hell (forget what happened there, exactly), Bob goes missing, and Enzo loses an eye and somehow returns as an adult man in the next episode...really dramatic and interesting stuff. The storyline where the now eye-less Enzo was searching around some kind of netherworld for Bob...everything was so different suddenly. Also, was the implication that Enzo had spent years searching, or did he just rapidly age? Can't remember.

Anyway, my main question is in the title.",television,"Am I misremembering things or was there an incredibly long wait before Bob returned during that legendary run of ""Reboot"" when Bob went missing?","Am I misremembering things or was there an incredibly long wait before Bob returned during that legendary run of ""Reboot"" when Bob went missing?"

Hi everyone! For those who don't know, My Husband Won't Fit/My Husband's Penis Won't Fit is a Japanese drama show currently streaming on Netflix. It's based on an autobiographical novel of the same name which deals with a certain issue that appeared during the author's relationship.

I've been dying to hear how others found the show since I finished it two days ago, but no discussion threads have popped up. It was an unexpectedly enjoyable and exceedingly weird ride that gripped me from episode to episode. I'd definitely recommend it to a lot of people.

48,"In the spirit of NCAA March Madness, I thought it'd be a fun experiment to pit some of the greatest/most popular TV shows against each other and see which one comes out on top. All credit goes to u/Power_To_Melt for coming up with the idea on the r/patientgamers sub. I thought it'd transfer pretty nicely over to TV shows as well.

The idea is to pick 128 TV shows that are generally critically/audience acclaimed, popular/well-known and/or considered as some of the best of all time. And then obviously we go through the rounds until we're left with one winner

**Selection Process:** I tried to be as diverse as possible, and include shows all throughout eras so you'll see shows from the 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s. There will definitely be more shows from the latter eras as I do believe that TV shows have gone up in quality overall. I used a combination of Metacritic, IMDB and various ""best-of"" lists, as well as general Reddit consensus, to decide which shows to include. Given the sheer number of shows available, you'll probably notice some omissions in my list, although I tried to make it as inclusive as possible. I think the ones I do have on my list are a pretty representative of what most people would consider ""great"". Also, I've limited this contest to **scripted/fictional shows only**. So you won't be seeing any news shows, stand ups or documentaries. I feel like those should be compared on an entirely different scale.

[Here is the list of all shows in the initial 128 bracket](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13qmSnY09EcDRZ1ltG-1kAUqRI9jDrryWQIODFzxwcEo/edit?usp=sharing)

**Seeding Process:** I personally felt that the best way to approach seeding would be to completely randomize it. This way, there won't be any bias on my end when pitting shows against each other. I had considered using an age-based seeding, where the oldest show would go up against the newest show, and we would move throughout the years like that, but again, I feel like leaving it up to chance is a much more fun method. It also leads to some truly unique matchups as you'll see soon. 

So with that in mind, I used a randomizer program to get the initial 64 matchups. The program gave me 64 sets of numbers, 2 numbers per set, and I used the #s from the initial Google Docs list (which is alphabetized), to pair the show matchups.

So without further ado [here is the r/television March Madness Round of 128!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J2daCZXj41MpECysPvQnNQ-a6JbedUjRPoJDl9yhKVA) I'll give everyone a couple of days to vote before tallying the results and creating the round of 64.

Let me know what you guys think, and if there are any changes I can make for the next round to improve the experience and process.

8,"The Sopranos (1999-2007) and Breaking Bad (2008-2013) are incontestable titans of television in their own respect, although they’re often compared and pitted against each other. How could they not be? Both are crime drama sagas with antihero ensembles, iconic settings, complex theme and moral scrutiny tied to first-rate writing and plot execution.

Now this is not a thread for mere “which is better” squabbles. I think rational fans can appreciate both series are 10/10 in nearly all departments. But does this statement hold true?

Breaking Bad is the superior drama series and The Sopranos is the greater crime series.

Drama is defined as telling one story and having a beginning, middle and ending with literary themes and motifs. BB is the better drama because it’s one progressive narrative with foreshadowing and subplots all pushing towards one conclusion. It’s already been compared to Shakespeare, especially a modern Macbeth. The arguments, family dinners and domestic settings add to a theatrical impression as well.

Every frame of every comprehensive episode of The Sopranos is quintessential crime drama served as dessert to any genre enthusiast. One of its heftiest “flaws” isn’t even negative - the lack of storylines and character arcs. Pilot to Finale, the world hasn’t shifted and our favorite characters would do it all again twice. Drama requires change and either growth or decay but The Sopranos refuses to dip out of reality and become so fictionally systematic.

I present my validation to you scathing Redditors.",television,DEBATE: The Sopranos is greater crime series / Breaking Bad is greater drama series,DEBATE: The Sopranos is greater crime series / Breaking Bad is greater drama series

While I have always enjoyed some of that stuff in moderation, the food and culture programming that I love has now been relegated to only a few hours on Saturday mornings.  

Just in the past couple weeks I have seen promotions for two more ghost shows. One starring Jack Osbourne and another that may take the cake for ridiculous crap called Ghost Bait. Two hosts make an attempt to help a victim of a haunting by covering their head in a burlap sack and luring spirits into some type of conflict resolution. I'm someone who is interested in the mysteries of the paranormal myself but unless I've recently been hit over the head with a hammer, I will not be watching Ghost Bait.

How do you see this going? I'm curious to see what they'll do to attract showrunners to this platform. Are they going to offer complete creative freedom? Great salaries? Are they going to take risks with great ideas that maybe the'd never have a green light at a conventional network?

For now I can't find that much information or what their library would be (I don't even know the price).

In a way, I'm happy that this is happening. The more competition, the better. It's so hard to produce anything. It's harder to produce something relatively good. It's even harder to produce a masterpiece.

If the competition is high, we'll see more networks/studios taking risks and this will be a good thing. I also think that everyone will try to offer interesting stuff to showrunners (like creative freedom, in order to attract them into their platform).

Low key however I think CBS All Access is really nice job establishing their service despite probably not having the budget others do to jut go shotgun approach. The Good Fight is one of the most critically buzzy shows on right now, the Twilight Zone is coming out at the perfect time to take advantage of Peele's popularity, a Star Trek show was a nice move as those fans were definitely going to follow it to CBS Access. Plus they have proven they are serious about building this because of all the money they're giving up by keeping their in-house shows there instead of selling them to Netflix or another service. With how much it's costing Netflix to have Friends and the Office, CBS is giving up a fortune to keep Big Bang on CBS All Access, in addition to other shows like Young Sheldon, Survivor, NCIS, etc. CBS approach looks similar to the WWE network to me where they originally had to take some financial hit of exchanging the pay per view dollars for subscriptions, but they knew this was the future.

So far it's about as entertaining as Law &amp; Order or CSI. I guess the crime scenes are a bit more grisly. Some dialogue is hammy (Graham shouting ""Don't psychoanalyze me!"" in the first episode comes to mind) or pretentious (he says his visions are like ""dust hanging on a cloud"" or something in episode three).

120,"Seems like a lot are coming back. Any that aren't (as of yet) but you'd like to see come back?

&amp;#x200B;

Mine are:

&amp;#x200B;

Definites:

&amp;#x200B;

Frasier - Already being discussed/in early development - but not officially announced yet. I will miss John Mahoney, but I think this could work. Frasier and Niles are strong characters and the show was incredibly witty. Would love to see a 2 or 3 season revival.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost - I know people will disagree with me on this one, but I feel the show has more to say and there's infinite directions it could go in. Given its definitive ending with almost everyone in the afterlife, I think it will be hard to revive, but there's so much they could do. Continue it as is, focusing on Hurley and Ben on island, and maybe Kate et all off island. No Matthew Fox (boo hoo) but it could definitely work. Pick up from the end of Season 5 and bring Fox back or bring Fox back as the smoke monster. Or even just use the island and have a new group of people deserted there with one or two cameos from previous cast. This is a show that could be brought back as a revival or a reboot or a mixture of both and still work!

&amp;#x200B;

Maybes:

&amp;#x200B;

Dexter - But please pretend the awful Season 8 never happened, pick up from the end of Season 7, and bring Debra back.

&amp;#x200B;

Friends - I think this could be fascinating. Even 1 episode or 1 short season. The creators keep saying no because that stage of the characters' lives are over (the 20's), BUT... just have a ""50 is the new 30"" angle and show the group coming back together as friends now that their kids have left the nest, which often happens in real life - people part ways after their 20's and pick up again in mid-life. Work the ""it's okay to be older"" angle. The cast still looks (yes, even Matt Le Blanc) mostly good and have aged as well as their ""Will &amp; Grace"" counterparts, so why not?

&amp;#x200B;

Given all the 90's sitcoms are coming back, I think there's three now mostly forgotten ones that could be rebooted:

&amp;#x200B;

Cybill - Not being discussed. I think this is unlikely to happen given how much Christine Baranski and Cybill Shepherd hate each other and that Cybill fell out with (most?) of the rest of the cast, but given how all the 90's sitcoms are being revived, I'd like to see a minimum 1 episode or 1 season revival of this, mainly just to tie up that nagging loose end/cliffhanger from the original show.

&amp;#x200B;

Ellen - Another sitcom that I feel never got a proper ending and was mainly cancelled because Ellen was gay (no matter what anyone says - yes, the show got a bit too preachy and Season 5 wasn't as good, but it could have run another season or 2). I'd mainly love to learn she went back, faced her homophobic co-worker, and got the bookstore Buy the Book back! I wonder why Ellen has never considered a reunion of this, even just for 1 episode. Probably too busy with her own talkshow.

&amp;#x200B;

Caroline in the City - Not one I'm particularly dying to see, but another one that was sort of abruptly cancelled for no reason on a cliffhanger. Back in the day,  I feel it could have run at least one more season. Not sure if there'd be a lot of interest now.

I recently got into The Sopranos and binged the whole thing. I must say it’s been one of the best if not the greatest show I’ve ever seen. Every character was unique, every underlying theme in every episode. David Chase is a poet, one hell of a writer and I will miss Gandolfini, he truly was a gem of an actor, sad he had gone so young. That being said I finally got past that controversial ending scene. I thought it was a bold and artistic choice, one that forces a viewer to think, maybe not for the specific answer but in general about the whole season again. I personally think it was Tony getting clipped as the show was his perspective so it makes sense to cut to an abrupt black screen. However it’s possible like Nolan did in the end of  Inception, that he was just creating a giant forum for wonder and debates and he never intended to have an answer for it other than that (which is a smart play as well) bc either way people would be talking about it for decades.

First, I was surprised there were so much as I heard mostly of the morning show. Second, most of those actually look very interesting with nice talent attached.

I know of the censorship from Apple rumors but considering the talent attached that seems weird to me (like would guys like Abrams, Moore, Spielberg, Chazelle or Watiti really do projects without their creative freedom? ).

It was widely believed that  American TV drama was at a peak in quality. Those shows are gone, but perhaps we are still at a peak in this area. 

But is there anyone who wishes to argue that we are at a peak in some genre, comedy, drama, children's, cartoons, long form drama, etc. 

This is not meant to be a completely negative view. Off hand I can not think of any genre where current TV is at its worst, but still I am asking is there a genre where we are currently at our best.

HE CHANGES MADE:

The original colourings of the red, green and yellow suit have been colour graded, boosted while retaining the battle damaged, wear and tear look.

WHAT THE CHANGES DO:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Giving us comic book accurate suit shows that the show-runners honour the character, source material and its history.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Seeing Robin in his (slightly beaten up) classic Red, Green and Yellow suit while brutalising enemies gives us a shocking and unsettling contrast to the the fun-loving, quippy “Boy Wonder” of the past, and his encounters with other heroes reflect that change.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The damage to the suit, with its slashes and dents, has worn down the colours, shows the dark surface that lies beneath, giving us a fairly physical representation of the what the character is going through and why he is angry towards his adoptive father and mentor.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Later in the show, Jason Todd, the Second Robin, saves Dick Grayson’s life and later the two Robins fight side by side. Jason’s suit, though slightly altered in design, has the exact same colouring to Dick’s. 

 

* However, had the classic colours been used for Grayson’s suit, we would see, alongside Jason’s already wild and brutal fighting style, that the new Robin is a quite literally a dark side version of his predecessor.

&amp;#x200B;

* As well as seeing how bad things are for Gotham, it would tell us that Batman is also in a much darker &amp; more unrestricted place, having selected a violent and volatile kid with serious personal problems to replace his wayward son, who he originally taken in to protect and rehabilitate.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Instead we got a “Dark and Edgy” Robin because thats what Studio Execs thinks is cool. I’m not sure they know its not the 1990s anymore.

PS LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK, ABOUT THE CHANGES I MADE, THE SHOW AND/OR THE SUIT.

43,"It has 17 tv show seasons which is pretty huge.

My favourite part remains Stargate SG-1 S1-S8, basically the original series when RDA was still the lead and they dealt with the cartoony but entertaining Goa'uld. I think the best parts were the 5 main characters (great chemistry, well developed) &amp; the strong worldbuiling. It doesn't take itself seriously like most shows these days &amp; I like that

S9-S10 were still fun but the team chemistry just wasn't the same with the two new characters and the Ori were kind of a bad too OP rehash of the Goa'uld 

SGA was a good spin off but for me it felt too much like SG1 2.0 at times and relied heavily on McKay (characters like Teyla or Aquaman were bland af). Also it didn't have a real ending so it's unsatisfying

SGU was way more interesting, maybe a bit too melodramatic at first but I think the serialized approach and more serious tone were refreshing after 15 seasons of the older style. Shame fans rejected it
